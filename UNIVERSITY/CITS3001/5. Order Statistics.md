A generalisation of familiar concepts like minimum, maximum and median. 
*The i-th order statistic of a set of n elements is the i-th smallest element.*
- min = 1st order stat
- max = nth order stat
- lower median = $\lfloor(n+1)/2\rfloor$
- upper median = $\lceil(n+1)/2\rceil$

## Selection Problem
Finding the i-th order statistic from a set of numbers. 
### Minimum and Maximum
```python
def minimum(xs: list[int]) -> int:
	result = xs[0]
	for i in range(1, len(xs)):
		if xs[i] < result:
			result = xs[i]
	return result
```
### Quickselect
- We could just sort and take the i-th element in $O(n lg n)$ time
- We don't care if two other elements are inverted, so as long as everything less than x is before x, and everything greater is after x
- So we only need to remove inversions of which x is a part
- Quicksort's partition method removes all inversions involving the pivot, and reports its index
- Hence we know which side of the pivot x must be on, and other side can't affect it
- Recursively partition just that side until our pivot lands at `i` and so must be `x`
```python
# Finds the ith order statistic of xs given it is in xs[lwr:upr]
def quickselect_range(xs: list[int], i: int, lwr: int, upr: int) -> int:
	mid = partition(xs, lwr, upr) # Same as quicksort
	# If result is in final location, we are done
	if mid == i-1:
		return xs[mid]
	# Otherwise recurse into whichever side the target is on
	if i-1 < mid:
		return quickselect_range(xs, i, lwr, mid)
	else:
		return quickselect_range(xs, i, mid+1, upr)

# Finds the ith order statistic of xs
def quickselect(xs: list[int], i: int) -> int:
	return quickselect_range(xs, i, 0, len(xs))

# Finds the ith order statistic of xs, same as above, just iterative
# instead of tail recursive
def quickselect_iterative(xs: list[int], i: int) -> int:
	# Invariant: Result is in xs[lwr:upr]
	lwr, upr = 0, len(xs)
	while upr - lwr > 1:
		mid = partition(xs, lwr, upr) # Same as quicksort
		# If result is in final location, we are done
		if mid == i-1:
			break
		# Otherwise adjust bounds based on which side the target is on
		if i-1 < mid:
			upr = mid
		else:
			lwr = mid+1
	return xs[i-1]
```
- In the worst case, we only remove one element, the pivot, with each partition, giving $O(n^2)$ overall, however we expect a good split half the time, so $O(n)$ is still the expected case

## Quickselect Pivot Selection
- To make quickselect $O(n)$ in the worst case, we need to guarantee a good split
- Perfect pivot is the median
- Splitting A into groups and taking the median of each group
- Smallest group with good properties (multiple less and greater than) is 5
```python
# This implementation assumes no duplicates and is not in-place.
# Implementations exist that are both in-place and robust to duplicates,
# but these are too verbose for lecture slides.
# Partitions xs[lwr:upr] by pivot and returns index of the pivot
def partition_by(xs: list[int], lwr: int, upr: int, pivot: int) -> int:
	below = [x for x in xs[lwr:upr] if x < pivot]
	above = [x for x in xs[lwr:upr] if x > pivot]
	xs[lwr:upr] = below + [pivot] + above
	return lwr + len(below)

def naive_median(xs: list[int]) -> int:
	return sorted(xs)[(len(xs) - 1) // 2]

# Nominates a good pivot value for xs[lwr:upr]
def median_of_medians(xs: list[int], lwr: int, upr: int) -> int:
	# Fall back to different median algorithm if too small
	if upr - lwr <= 5:
		return naive_median(xs[lwr:upr])
	# Compute medians of groups of 5
	groups = [xs[i:i+5] for i in range(lwr, upr-4, 5)]
	medians = list(map(naive_median, groups))
	# Return median of medians
	return quickselect(medians, (len(medians) + 1) // 2)

# Finds the ith order statistic of xs
def quickselect(xs: list[int], i: int) -> int:
	lwr, upr = 0, len(xs)
	while upr - lwr > 1:
	# Partition by recursively selected pivot
		pivot = median_of_medians(xs, lwr, upr)
		mid = partition_by(xs, lwr, upr, pivot)
		if mid == i-1:
			break
		if i-1 < mid:
			upr = mid
		else:
			lwr = mid+1
	return xs[i-1]
```
