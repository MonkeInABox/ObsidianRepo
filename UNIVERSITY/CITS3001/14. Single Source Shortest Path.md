## Shortest Path
- The length of a path in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path
- The shortest path between vertices `v` and `u` is any path from `u` to `v` such that no other path has lower length
- The single source shortest path problem asks us to find the shortest paths from that vertex to every other vertex
