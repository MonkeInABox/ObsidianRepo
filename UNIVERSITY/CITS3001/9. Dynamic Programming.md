#### or the one where Gozz says ~Memowisation~

> The name of a problem solving technique. Simplifies a problem by defining its solution in terms of the optimal substructure of overlapping subproblems.

## Memoization
- Both top-down and bottom-up required us to reuse solutions to subproblems
- This saves us from having to recursively recompute solutions repeatedly
- DP only applies to overlapping subproblems, as otherwise there is nothing to reuse
- We store the solutions in a DP table so we can look them up again as required
- This process is called memoization

## Counting Leaf-Paths in a DAG Bottom-Up
``` python
# Bottom-up DP to count leaf-paths from each vertex in DAG
def num_leaf_paths(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
	dptable = [0] * len(adjlist)
	for u in reversed(toposort(adjlist)):
		if not adjlist[u]:
			dptable[u] = 1
		else:
			dptable[u] = sum(dptable[v] for v in adjlist[u])
			#explicitly done in reverse, so children are always eval'd first
	return dptable
```
## Counting Leaf-Paths in a DAG Top-Down
``` python
# Top-down DP to count leaf-paths from given vertex in DAG
def __num_leaf_paths_from(adjlist: list[list[int]], root: int) -> int:
	dptable: list[None | int] = [None] * len(adjlist)
	def recurrence(u: int):
		if dptable[u] is not None: # have we computed answer
			return dptable[u]
		if not adjlist[u]:      # its a leaf
			dptable[u] = 1
		else: #recursively call function for all children
			dptable[u] = sum(recurrence(v) for v in adjlist[u])
		return dptable[u]
	return recurrence(root)

##------OR------##

# Top-down DP to count leaf-paths from given vertex in DAG
def num_leaf_paths_from(adjlist: list[list[int]], root: int) -> int:
	@functools.cache            # automatically memoize the recurrence
	def recurrence(u: int):
		if not adjlist[u]:
			return 1
		return sum(recurrence(v) for v in adjlist[u])
	return recurrence(root)
```

## Steps for DP
- State: `How much we still owe`
- Action: `Give them one coin, we now owe them less`
- Base Case: `If we owe them nothing, we can pay that with 0 coins`
- Recurrence: `Consider giving each coin, whichever is fewest, including this coin`

## Coin Change Bottom-Up
```python
def coin_change_bottomup(amount: int, coins: list[int]) -> int | None:
	dptable: list[int] = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1) # Sentinel value
	dptable[0] = 0 # Base case
	# Known evaluation order, no need to toposort
	for x in range(1, len(dptable)):
		for c in coins:
			if c <= x:
				dptable[x] = min(dptable[x], dptable[x-c] + 1)
	return dptable[amount] if dptable[amount] <= amount else None
```
$O(X)$ states in total, $O(|C|)$ for each state, at most, therefore $O(X|C|)$ time overall, $O(X)$ value.
