## Longest Common Subsequence
- A subsequence is any sequence that can be constructed by removing any number of elements from their original sequence
- What is their longest common subsequence (LCS)
- Naively, construct every subsequence of X and check each to see if it is a subsequence of Y
- Every element is either in the subsequence or not, giving $2^m$ subsequences of X
- State: A pair (i, j) corresponding to a prefix $X_i$ and $Y_j$ of each sequence
- Base Case: The LCS of an empty sequence with any other sequence must be empty
- Recurrence: If $x_i = y_j$, extend (i-1, j-1) otherwise take the best of (i-1, j) and (i, j-1)
```python
def lcs_len(X: str, Y: str) -> int:
	rows, cols = len(X) + 1, len(Y) + 1
	dpt = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
	for i in range(1, rows):
		for j in range(1, cols):
			if X[i-1] == Y[j-1]: # Note 0-indexing
				dpt[i][j] = dpt[i-1][j-1] + 1
		else:
			dpt[i][j] = max(dpt[i-1][j], dpt[i][j-1])
	return dpt[-1][-1]
```
- $O(|X||Y|)$

## Knapsack Optimal
```python
def knapsack_opt(capacity: int, items: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
	dpt = [0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)]
	for wi, vi in items:
		for w in reversed(range(wi, len(dpt))):
			dpt[w] = max(dpt[w], dpt[w-wi] + vi)
	return dpt[-1]
```
- $O(NW)$ for time (where W is weight), memory is $O(W)$. 

## For O(WN) Memory
```python 
def knapsack(capacity: int, items: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
	rows, cols = len(items) + 1, capacity + 1
	dpt = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
	for i in range(1, rows):
		wi, vi = items[i-1]
		for w in range(1, cols):
			if w < wi:
				dpt[i][w] = dpt[i-1][w]
			else:
				dpt[i][w] = max(dpt[i-1][w], dpt[i-1][w-wi] + vi)
	return dpt[-1][-1]
```
