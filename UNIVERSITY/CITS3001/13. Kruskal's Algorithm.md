## Prim's Algorithm
Constructs a minimum spanning tree for a given graph
- Begin with a trivial tree containing some arbitrary vertex and no edges
- Maintain a collection of all edges that could be used to add a new vertex to the tree
- Repeatedly greedily pick the lowest weight edge from this collection and add it to the tree
- Once every vertex has been added to the tree, we have an MST
- Using a binary heap as our priority queue gives $O(|V|lg|V| + |E|lg|V|)$

## Kruskal's Algorithm
Another MST algorithm is Kruskal's:
- Same strategy as Prim's, but flipped:
	- Prim collects edges that grow the tree and greedily selects the one with the lowest weight
	- Kruskal collects lower weight ends and greedily selects one that will grow the tree
- Start with all vertices disconnected
- Consider all edges in increasing weight order
- Add any edge that joins two trees into one
- Stop when we have just one tree, this is the MST
```python
Vertex = int
Weight = int
Edge = tuple[Vertex, Vertex, Weight]
def kruskals(num_verts: int, edges: list[Edge]) -> Weight:
	edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
	tree = [i for i in range(num_verts)] # Vertex i is in tree tree[i]
	total_weight = 0
	for u, v, w in edges:
		if tree[u] != tree[v]: # If {u, v} would connect two trees
			total_weight += w
			new_tree, old_tree = tree[u], tree[v]
			for i in range(len(tree)): # Move verts from v's tree to u's
				if tree[i] == old_tree:
					tree[i] = new_tree
	return total_weight
```
- This is $O(|V|)$ scan to update for every edge, therefore $O(|V|^2 + |E|lg|E|)$ overall.
- For more efficient:
	- Test if a pair of vertices are in the same tree
	- Merge their trees if not

## Disjoint Sets
- Two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common
- Kruskal requires a set of sets all disjoint from each other
- Disjoint set data structure also known as union-find:
	- replace two sets with their union
	- determine to which set a given element belongs
#### Forest Representation
- Each element points to leader, we leave them pointing to old leader and point old leader to new leader. This is a forest.
- Each set is a tree in the forest, a union is only $O(N)$  for find
#### Union By Height
- Shorter tree = Better performance
- Attach the shorter tree to the taller
- For a tree to increase in height, it must be the union of two trees of the same height
- Therefore minimum number of elements in a tree of height $h$, must be double that for height $h-1$
- A tree of height $h$ must contain at least $2^h$ elements, tallest tree therefore has height $log_{2}n$
- Therefore find is now $O(lgN)$ 
#### Path Compression
- `find(x)` determines `x`'s current leader, the root of its tree
- This must also be the leader for all of `x`'s ancestors
```python
class DisjointSets:
	def __init__(self, num_sets: int):
		self.__parent = [i for i in range(num_sets)]
		self.__rank = [0 for _ in range(num_sets)]
	
	def make_set(self) -> int:
		i = len(self.__parent)
		self.__parent.append(i)
		self.__rank.append(0)
		return i

	# find tree by walking then compress path
	def find(self, i: int) -> int:
		# Find the root of i's tree
		root = i # this is going to END UP being the root 
		while self.__parent[root] != root:
			root = self.__parent[root]
		# Make all of i's ancestors children of the root
		curr = i
		while self.__parent[curr] != curr:
			parent = self.__parent[curr]
			self.__parent[curr] = root
			curr = parent
		return root

	# attach leader with lower rank to the one with higher rank and update
	def union(self, i: int, j: int):
		i = self.find(i)
		j = self.find(j)
		if i == j: # Nothing to do, already same set
			return
		if self.__rank[i] < self.__rank[j]:
			i, j = j, i
		self.__parent[j] = i
		self.__rank[i] = max(self.__rank[i], self.__rank[j] + 1)
	# this is O(lgN) worst case for find

def kruskals(num_verts: int, edges: list[Edge]) -> Weight:
	sets = DisjointSets(num_verts)
	edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
	total_weight = 0
	for u, v, w in edges:
		if sets.find(u) != sets.find(v):
			total_weight += w
			sets.union(u, v)
	return total_weight
```
- Any sequence of m operations on n sets will take at most $O(m\alpha(n))$ time where $\alpha(n)$ is:
$$ \alpha(n) = min(k|A_{k}(1) \geq n) $$
- where $A_k(1)$ is the Ackermann function
- $O(|E|log|E|)$ overall
