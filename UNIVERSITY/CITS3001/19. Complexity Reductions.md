## Reduction
- To show something is NP-hard, we must show it is at least as hard as everything else in NP
- If we already know an NP-hard problem, it suffices to show it is at least as hard as that
- Lets say easy is "can be solved in polynomial time"
- **Goal**: Show that if B can be solved in polynomial time then so can A
- We can do this if we can find an algorithm that uses B to solve A
- But we have to make sure it stays within polynomial time:
	- We can do at most polynomial work directly
	- We can call B at most polynomially-many times (product of polynomials is polynomial)

## NP-Hardness 
- This gives us a kind of lower bound on the problem
- This is what we mean when we say the problems in NP-hard are "as hard as anything in NP"
- To prove a problem NP-hard, it is sufficient to show a reduction to H from some other NP-hard problem, K, as then every problem in NP can be reduced to H via K

## Cook-Levin Theorem
- States that the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is NP-complete (hence, NP-hard)
- SAT is a decision problem that asks if there is an assignment of Boolean variables
- General observation is that you can (in polynomial time) construct a Boolean formula that predicts the output of an NTM
- This means SAT is able to simulate an NTM, and hence any problem in NP, meaning any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT

## Travelling Salesman Problem
- Very similar to Hamiltonian cycle (HAM-CYCLE) but instead of finding any cycle, we want a cycle of minimum possible weight
