>TORQUE = angle of rotation, relations for cylindrical members

- Torsion refers to the twisting of a straight bar when it is loaded by moments (twisting moments or torques) that produce rotation about longitudinal axis of the bar when it is loaded by moments (torques)
- Cylindrical members that are subject to torques and transmit power through rotation are called shafts
- Torque applied to shaft produces shearing stresses on the faces perpendicular to the axis
- When subjected to torsion, every cross-section of a circular shaft remains plane and undistorted

#### Angle of Rotation
$\varphi =\Sigma \frac{TL}{JG}$
- $G$ is the shear modulus
- $J$ is the polar moment of inertia $m^{4}$
$J = \frac{1}{2} \pi c^{4}$
- $c$ is the radius, if hollow: $c^{4} = (c_{2}^{4}-c_{1}^{4})$

#### Torsional Stiffness and Torsional Flexibility
- $\frac{GJ}{L}$ is the torsional stiffness, torque required to produce a unit angle of rotation
- $\frac{L}{GJ}$ is the torsional flexibility, angle of rotation per unit torque

#### Shear Strains Within the Shaft
$\gamma_{z\theta} = \frac{r\varphi}{L}$
- Shear strain is the linear function of polar radius ($r$)
- The strain is zero at the centre and reaches a max value at the outer surface (when r == c)
$\gamma = \frac{\gamma_{max}}{c}r$
- Shear strains are maximum on outside surface, minimum on inside surface

#### Stress in Linearly Elastic
$\tau_{z\theta} = G\gamma_{z\theta}$
$\tau = \frac{\tau_{max}}{c}r$
$\tau_{max} = \frac{Tc}{J}$
$\tau_{min} = \frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}}\tau_{max}$

#### Limitations
- Are limited to shafts of circular cross-section that behave in a linearly elastic manner
- Equations are valid only in parts of the shafts away from the stress concentrators
- These can also **NOT** be used for shafts of other shapes

#### Application to Failure of Brittle & Ductile Materials
- Brittle sample fails along surfaces that are perpendicular to the direction in which tension is maximum
	- Generally fail in *tension*
- A specimen made of a ductile material fails along a plane perpendicular to its longitudinal axis
	- Generally fail in *shear*
