When a beam with a straight longitudinal axis is loaded by lateral forces, the axis is deformed into a curve, called the deflection curve of the beam
$\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{M_{z}}{EI_{z}}$
Where $\rho$ is the curvature radius of the beam
$EI\frac{1}{\rho} = M(x)=EI\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}$

#### Boundary Conditions
Pertain to the deflections and slopes at the supports of the beam, for example, at a simple support, the deflection is zero and at a fixed support, both the deflection and slope are zero
