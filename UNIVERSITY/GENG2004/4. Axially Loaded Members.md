## Changes in Length of Non-Uniform Bars
- Change in length (elongation or shortening) is called displacement, deformation is used in the sense of strain
- Displacement has units of length
- Strain is dimensionless
- $$ \varepsilon = \frac{\delta}{L}$$
	- Where $\delta$ is the change in length and $L$ is the original length

## Statically Indeterminate Structures
- When statics (equilibrium equations) are not sufficient, the system is statically indeterminate
- We must thus use additional equations pertaining to the displacement of the structure
- **Compatibility Equation** expresses the fact that the change in length of the bar must be compatible with the boundary conditions at the supports
- This is used through the superposition method
	- $\delta = \delta _{L} + \delta _{R} = 0$

## Thermal Effects
- Temperature change results in a change in length or *thermal strain*
- $\delta _{T} = \alpha (\Delta T)L$
	- Where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion
