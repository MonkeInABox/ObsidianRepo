$$σ = f(ε)$$
- We need to understand material components and properties to design machines, machine components, structures, etc.

## Static and Dynamic Loading Conditions:
- 2 types of loading used:
	- *Static test* - the load is applied slowly, at a constant rate
	- *Dynamic test* - the load is applied rapidly, the rate of loading is set. The time during which the sample is loaded is comparable with time of elastic wave propagating through the sample

## Stress Strain Diagrams
![[Pasted image 20240323111727.png]]
- *Linear part* (OA), this is Young's Modulus and the value at A is the proportional limit
- AB is *non-linear elastic* behaviour
- B is the **YIELD POINT**
- BC is perfectly elastic behaviour or yielding
- CD is strain hardening (changes in the crystalline structure), reaches maximum value at D, the ultimate stress (where necking occurs), then failure at E
- **Offset Method**: To find the offset yield stress, draw a line at 0.002 of the strain
- **Creep**: when the sample is loaded for a long period of time its properties may change, i.e. the stress in a wire gradually decreases (relaxation)
- **Fatigue**: is shown on stress-N diagrams, where N is the number of repetitions, the endurance limit is the stress for which failures do not occur, even for indefinitely large number of loading cycles
