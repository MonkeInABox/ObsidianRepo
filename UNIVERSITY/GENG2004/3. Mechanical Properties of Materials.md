$$σ = f(ε)$$
- We need to understand material components and properties to design machines, machine components, structures, etc.

## Static and Dynamic Loading Conditions:
- 2 types of loading used:
	- *Static test* - the load is applied slowly, at a constant rate
	- *Dynamic test* - the load is applied rapidly, the rate of loading is set. The time during which the sample is loaded is comparable with time of elastic wave propagating through the sample
