#### Method Summary
- The analysis of a statically indeterminate structure involves setting up and solving equations of equilibrium, force-displacement relations and equations of compatibility.
- The equilibrium equations relate the loads acting on the structure to the unknown forces and the compatibility equations express conditions on the displacements of structure.

$\sigma_{22aver}=\sigma_{0}=\frac{P}{A}$  
$\sigma_{11aver}=0=\sigma_{12aver}$ 
$K=3 (x_{1}=a, x_{2}=0)$
$K=-1(x_{1}=0, x_{2}=a)$

#### Saint Venant's Principle
- Complex load can be replaced with a statically equivalent simpler one
	- Total force and moment are preserved
- This affects only a vicinity of the surface where the load is applied
- Statically equivalent means that load systems have the same force resultant and the same moment resultant
- The peak stress directly under the applied load may be several times higher than average ($\sigma=\frac{P}{bt})$ where $b$ is the width of the bar
- The max stress decays rapidly as we move away from where the load is applied
