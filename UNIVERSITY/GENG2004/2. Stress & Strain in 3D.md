## Stress
- Stress tensor, matrix 3x3 - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments.
$$
lim_{change in S}dF/dS = t_n
$$

$$
o_{11}, o_{22}, o_{33} 
$$
- The **NORMAL** stresses, the others are in tangent to the planes, and are the shear stresses. 
- o$_{12}$ = o$_{21}$ 
- $[o_{ij}]=[t_n]=[F/A]=Nm^{-2}=Pa$
- **STRESS** (stress tensor, matrix 3x3) - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments

## Compression & Tension
- Sign convention: for normal stress components, tension is positive, compression is negative. Anti-Clockwise is positive.
- If a bar is loaded in compression instead of tension, will have negative sign
- Shear stress components will change orientation
- All stresses will have the directions opposite to those for a bar in tension


## Transform Matrix
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$œÉ' = A . œÉ . A^{T}$$
- WHERE:
	- œÉ' is the new transformed matrix
	- A is the above matrix where:
		- if rotated about x-axis:
			- $$a_{11} = cos(x_{1}', x_{1}) = cos(0)=1$$
				- as it rotates about x-axis, the changed position of x is equal to the old position
				- this continues through the matrix, where we just fill in the angles between the points
	- A<sup>T</sup> is the transposed matrix of A, where row x becomes column x all throughout the matrix

## Method of Inclined Planes
- $$A_{0}/A_{theta} = cos(theta)$$
- Where A<sub>theta</sub> is the actual face side (hypotenuse) and A<sub>0</sub> is the projected area on the "y-axis"
- $$œÉ = F / A_{theta}$$
- $$ùúè = V/A_{theta}$$
- where: $$F=Pcos(theta)$$ and $$V=Psin(theta)$$

## Stress Transformation in 3D
- Always use formulae for *multiaxial loading*
- If under uniaxial loading:
	- use either stress transformation in 3D or method of inclined planes

## Traction Vectors & Stress
- \[t<sub>n</sub>] = \[Force/Area] = Nm<sup>-2</sup> = Pa
- Einstein's Rule of Summation:
	- t<sub>i</sub> = œÉ<sub>ij</sub> n<sub>j</sub> 
	- \[œÉ<sub>ij</sub>] = \[t<sub>n</sub>]
	- œÉ<sub>kk</sub> = œÉ<sub>11</sub> + œÉ<sub>22</sub> + œÉ<sub>33</sub>

## Volumetric Strain : Dilation
- Change of volume in tension
- Volume before: V<sub>0</sub>  = abc
- Volume after: V<sub>1</sub> = (a + aŒµ<sub>11</sub>)(b + bŒµ<sub>22</sub>)(c + cŒµ<sub>33</sub>)
- The unit volume change = e = (V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>0</sub>)/V<sub>0</sub>
- Since strains are small: e = Œµ<sub>11</sub> + Œµ<sub>22</sub> + Œµ<sub>33</sub>
- *e* is the volumetric strain or *dilation*

## Relationship between Young's mod (E), Poisson's ratio (v) and shear mod (G)
- Established through generalized Hooke's law

## Generalised Hooke's Law
$$œÉ_{11} = (Œª+2Œº)Œµ_{11} + ŒªŒµ_{22} + ŒªŒµ_{33}$$
$$œÉ_{22} = (Œª+2Œº)Œµ_{22} + ŒªŒµ_{11} + ŒªŒµ_{33} $$
$$œÉ_{33} = (Œª+2Œº)Œµ_{33} + ŒªŒµ_{22} + ŒªŒµ_{11}$$
$$ œÉ_{12} = 2ŒºŒµ_{12}$$
$$ œÉ_{13} = 2ŒºŒµ_{13}$$
$$ œÉ_{23} = 2ŒºŒµ_{23}$$
- The law describes linear elastic material response to multiaxial loading (3D) in isotropic solid body.
- The constants relating to this law are the elastic moduli (lambda, mu, E, G (shear modulus), v (Poisson's ratio), K (bulk modulus))
	- Only 2 of these constants are independent for isotropic material
