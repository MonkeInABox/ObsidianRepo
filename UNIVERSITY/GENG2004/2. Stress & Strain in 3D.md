## Stress:
- Stress tensor, matrix 3x3 - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments.
$$
lim_{change in S}dF/dS = t_n

$$
o_{11}, o_{22}, o_{33} 
$$
- The **NORMAL** stresses, the others are in tangent to the planes, and are the shear stresses. 
- o$_{12}$ = o$_{21}$ 
- $[o_{ij}]=[t_n]=[F/A]=Nm^{-2}=Pa$
- **STRESS** (stress tensor, matrix 3x3) - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments

## Compression & Tension:
- Sign convention: for normal stress components, tension is positive, compression is negative. Anti-Clockwise is positive.
- If a bar is loaded in compression instead of tension, will have negative sign
- Shear stress components will change orientation
- All stresses will have the directions opposite to those for a bar in tension


## Transform Matrix:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$σ' = A . σ . A^{T}$$
- WHERE:
	- σ' is the new transformed matrix
	- A is the above matrix where:
		- if rotated about x-axis:
			- $$a_{11} = cos(x_{1}', x_{1}) = cos(0)=1$$
				- as it rotates about x-axis, the changed position of x is equal to the old position
				- this continues through the matrix, where we just fill in the angles between the points
	- A<sup>T</sup> is the transposed matrix of A, where row x becomes column x all throughout the matrix
