## Stress:
- Stress tensor, matrix 3x3 - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments.
$$
lim_{change in S}dF/dS = t_n

$$
o_{11}, o_{22}, o_{33} 
$$
- The **NORMAL** stresses, the others are in tangent to the planes, and are the shear stresses. 
- o$_{12}$ = o$_{21}$ 
- $[o_{ij}]=[t_n]=[F/A]=Nm^{-2}=Pa$
- **STRESS** (stress tensor, matrix 3x3) - relationship with normal, shear force and bending and torsional moments

## Compression & Tension:
- Sign convention: for normal stress components, tension is positive, compression is negative.
- If a bar is loaded in compression instead of tension, will have negative sign
- Shear stress components will change orientation
- All stresses will have the directions opposite to those for a bar in tension
