# Shading Model
- Used to calculate the colour of an illuminated position on the surface of an object, the lighting or illumination model
	- Considers: light attributes, interaction, surface attributes
	- Light is partially absorbed and partially scattered
		- Smoothness and orientation
	- Rendering equation is a **global illumination** model which considers many effects
		- Reflection
		- Shadows
		- Multiple scatterings from object to object
## Local vs. Global Model
- Local does not track inter-reflections
- Correct shading requires global calculation, incompatible with pipeline architecture which shades each polygon independently
## Finite-sized Light Sources and Shadows
- Real light sources have a finite size
- Simple light sources:
	- Point
		- $p_{0}=(x,y,z,1)^{T}$ with illumination intensity $I=(I_{r}, I_{g}, I_{b})$
		- Illuminates equally in all directions
		- Distance term can be incorporated to attenuate $I$
	- Directional
		- Parallel rays of light
		- $d=(x,y,z,0)^{T}$ and intensity $I=(I_{r}, I_{g}, I_{b})$
	- Spotlight
		- Cone whose apex is at $p_{s}$, a direction $I_s$, a cone angle $\theta$, and intensity $I=(I_{r}, I_{g}, I_{b})$
		- If $\theta = 180$, the spotlight is a point source     
	- Ambient
		- Models same amount of light everywhere in scene, ambient illumination $I_{a}=(I_{r}, I_{g}, I_{b})$ is an intensity that is identical at every point
- Light attenuation is generally modelled by $\frac{1}{a+bd+cd^{2}}$
# Phong Reflection Model
- Models local illumination: diffuse term, specular term, ambient term
- 4 vectors:
	- $l$ to light source
	- $v$ to viewer
	- $n$ normal to point $p$
	- $r$ perfect reflector of $l$ with respect to $n$ (angle of reflection)
## Lambertian Surface
- The amount of light that reflects from surface is proportional to the cosine of the light's angle of incidence
	- $cos\theta_{1}=l.n$ where $l,n$ are normalised to unit vectors
	- Three coefficients $k_{r}, k_{g}, k_{b}$ that show how much of each colour component is reflected
	- $I_{diffuse}=k_{d}L_{d}cos\theta$ , $L_{d}$ is incoming intensity
## Specular Reflections
- $cos^{\alpha}\phi$ that drops off as the angle between viewer and ideal reflection increased
- $I_{specular}~k_{s}L_{s}cos^{\alpha}\phi$ 
- $\alpha$ is the shininess coefficient, 100-200 is metallic, 5-10 is plastic, controls the falloff sharpness
## Ambient Reflection
- $I_{ambient}= k_{a}L_{a}$
