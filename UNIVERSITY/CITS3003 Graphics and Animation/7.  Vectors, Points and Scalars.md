# Points, Scalars and Vectors
- **Point** (Fundamental Geometric Object)
	- Location in space
	- Cannot add or scale points
- **Scalar**
	- Real/complex numbers
	- Used to specify quantities
	- Obey a set of rules
- **Vector**
	- Is any quantity with direction and magnitude
	- Can be added, scaled and rotated
## Vector
- Two points can be thought of as defining a vector $v=P-Q$
- Normalising a vector $a^{hat} = \frac{a}{|a|}=\frac{vector}{magnitude}$
- Dot (inner) product $u.v=|u||v|cos\theta$
	- This can also be used to find angle
	- $|u|^2=u.u$ 
	- if $u.v=0$ they are perpendicular
- Cross Product $n=u \bigtimes v$
	- $u\bigtimes v=|u||v|sin\theta$
	- Produces a perpendicular vector to the plane defined by the two original vectors
- Linear independence $a_1v_1+a_2v_2+...a_nv_n=0$ `iff` $a_1=a_2=...=0$
	- We cannot represent any vector in terms of other vectors in the set
## Dimension
- In a vector space, the maximum number of linearly independent vectors is fixed and called the dimension (n-dimensional space has n linearly independent vectors)

# Coordinate Frame
- A coordinate system or frame is determined by the origin and basis vectors $(P_0, v_1, v_2, v_3)$ = a point
	- Every vector $w$ can be written as a combination of $v$s
	- Every point $P$ can be written by $P_0 +$ some combination of $v$s
- Homogeneous coordinate representation
	- $w=[\alpha _1\space \alpha _2 \space \alpha _3 \space 0]^T$
	- $P=[\beta _1\space \beta _2 \space \beta _3 \space 1]^T$
## Change of Coordinate System
- Transformation of two bases
	- $\{v1, v2, v3\}$ and $\{u1, u2, u3\}$
	- Each basis vector in the second set can be represented in terms of first basis
		- $u=Mv$
		- $M=\begin{bmatrix} y1 & y2 & y3 \\ y4 & y5 & y6 \\ y7 & y8 & y9 \end{bmatrix}$
		- $a^Tv=b^TMv$
		- $a=M^Tb$
			- Where $a$ is w.r.t. the first basis ($v$), $b$ to the second ($u$)
	- Similarly for coordinate frames
		- $M=\begin{bmatrix} y1 & y2 & y3 & 0\\ y4 & y5 & y6 & 0\\ y7 & y8 & y9 & 0 \\ y10 & y11 & y12 & 1\end{bmatrix}$
