# 3D Sierpinski Gasket
- 2D Sierpinski triangle to 3D by defining a tetrahedron with four triangular faces
- Divide up each face separately and draw each using a different colour
- We want to see only those surfaces that are in front of other surfaces
- OpenGL uses the z-buffer algorithm, saves depth information of fragments as they are rendered so that only the front fragments appear in the image, therefore it cannot be done at the vertex shader
## The z-buffer algorithm
- Easy to implement
- Compatible with pipeline architectures, can be executed at the speed at which fragments are passed through the pipeline
- Works in the image space and determines the visibility of each surface for each pixel position
- Suppose rasterising one of two polygons:
	- Compute colour for each point `p`
	- Must check whether `p` visible (closest to camera)
```
for eachPixel(i, j) do
	z-buffer[i,j] //FAR
	Framebuffer[i,j] //background colour
end for
for eachPolygon do
	for each pixel(i,j) occupied by polygon do
		compute depthZ and shadeS of polygon at (i,j)
		if Z<z-buffer[i,j] then
			z-buffer[i,j] = Z
			Framebuffer[i,j] = S
		end if
	end for
end for
```
- In OpenGL, the z-buffer must be:
```cpp
//requested in main()
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE|GLUT_RGB|GLUT_DEPTH);

//enabled in init()
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

//cleared in display callback
glClear(GL_COLOUR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```
## The Painter's Algorithm
- Similar to oil paint
- Background colours first, then nearer and so forth
- Also known as a depth-sort algorithm
- Fails when polygons pierce or form a cycle of depth overlap

# Element Buffers
- We can reuse vertices while defining triangles for efficiency
- `GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`

# 3D Model File Format
- Follow similar convention:
	- A list of vertices
	- A list of elements as integers
## \*.PLY Format
- Describes as a collection of vertices faces and elements, contains the description of exactly one object
