## The synthetic camera model
- Need functions to specify:
	- objects
	- a viewer
	- light sources
	- material properties

## Extension Library - GLEW
- Makes it easy to access OpenGL extensions available on a particular system
`glew.h; glewInit();`

# OpenGL/GLUT Basics
## OpenGL's function is rendering
- Converting geometric/mathematical object descriptions into images
- No functions for window management (create, resize, etc)
## GLUT
- Provides basic functions for window management
- Interfaces with different windowing systems
- freeGLUT adds capabilities
## Software Organisation
HIGH LEVEL
- OpenGL program
- GLEW, GL, GLUT remove OS dependencies and add windowing
- GLX provides functions
- Xlib, Xt provids functions for GLX
- `*.dll` Graphics Driver
LOW LEVEL

## OpenGL Context and State
- The state of OpenGL is the context, with default values for colour, transformations, lighting, camera, textures...
- Maintains a list for current values of attributes, the state variables
- From the perspective of the API, there are two types of graphics functions:
1. Functions that wither change the state inside the machine or return the state information: `glEnable(GL_LIGHTING); glDisable(GL_BLEND);`
2. Functions that perform some operations based on the current state of the machine: `glColor3f(0.0,0.0,0.0); glPointSize(1.5);`
## Functions and Primitives
- **Primitives**: points, line segments, triangles
```
GL_POINTS;
GL_LINES;
GL_LINE_STRIP; #join points
GL_LINE_LOOP;
GL_TRIANGLES;
GL_TRIANGLE STRIP;
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN;
```
- **Types**
```
GLfloat;
GLdouble;
GLint;
vec.h, mat.h;
vec2; vec3; mat2; mat3; mat4;
```
- **Attributes**: way primitive appears
	- Colour, size, width, pattern, polygon mode (filled, edges? vertices?)
- **Transformation**: rotation, scaling
- **Viewing**: specifies various views
- **Control (GLUT)**: communicate with window system, initialise, deal with errors
- **Query**: get information about API
## Format of OpenGL functions
- `glUniform` specifies value of a uniform variable for the current program object
`glUniform3f(x,y,z)` gl = GL library, Uniform = function name, 3 = dimensions, f(x,y,z) = floats x, y and z
## OpenGL `#defines`
- Most constants are defined in the include files `gl.h`, `glu.h` and `glut.h`
	- `#include <GL/glut.h>` should automatically include the others

**Rendering Steps**:
1. Generate vertices (2 triangles = 6 vertices)
2. Store the vertices in array
3. Create GPU buffer for vertices
4. Move array of vertices from CPU to GPU buffer
5. Draw 6 points from array on GPU using `glDrawArray`
