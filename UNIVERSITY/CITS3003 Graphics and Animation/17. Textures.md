# 3 Types of Mapping
- Occurs at the end of the rendering pipeline
	- Very efficient as few triangles make it past clipper
## Texture Mapping
- Uses an image (or texture map) to influence the colour of a fragment
- A 2D image represented by 2D array texture\[height]\[width]
	- These elements are texels, with coordinates (s,t)
- For mapping from object coordinates to texture coordinates, we need mapping of the form:
	- $s(x,y,z), t(x,y,z)$
- Forward texture mapping = mapping from texture space to screen space
- Inverse texture mapping = mapping from screen space to texture space and is often needed in rendering
	- 2 part mapping
		- First part: intermediate object that is closest to the 3D object to map texture to, and mapping the texture to this object
			- Common intermediate objects
				- Cylinder: $$x=rcos2\pi u, y=rsin2\pi u, z = v \times h |s=u,t=v$$
				- Sphere: $$x=rcos2\pi u, y = rsin2\pi ucos2\pi v, z=rsin2\pi usin2\pi v|s=u,t=v$$
				- 
		- Second part: Map from intermediate object to actual object
			- 3 ways:
				- Normals from int to actual
				- Normals from actual to int
				- Vectors from centre of int
## Environment Mapping
- Uses a picture of the environment as a texture map, allows to simulate highly specular surfaces
## Bump
- Adds small distortions to the surface normals
