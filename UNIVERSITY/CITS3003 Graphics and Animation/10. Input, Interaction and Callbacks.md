# Input Devices
2 types, logical and physical, logical devices describe the type of input, not the device itself
## Pointing Devices
- Allow user to indicate a position on screen, e.g. a mouse
- **Relative Positioning**
	- Devices such as mouse, trackball and joystick return incremental inputs to OS
- **Absolute Positioning**
	- Devices such as a tablet return position directly to the OS
## Keyboard Devices
- Return character codes (ASCII code)

# Logical Input Devices
- Graphics APIs define different types of logical devices based on the kind of data the device provides
	- **Locator** is a device that provides a position in world coordinates to the user program
		- Usually a pointing device
	- **Choice** is a device that allows the user to select one of the discrete number of options
		- OpenGL can use widgets such as menus and scroll bars
	- **String** is a device that provides ASCII strings to the user program
	- **Stroke** is a device that returns an array of location
	- **Valuator** is a device that returns analogue input to the user program, such as a slide bar
	- **Pick** is a device that returns the identifier of an object on the display to the user program
# Input Modes
- Provides an input to the application program:
	- Measure (value returned to program)
		- 3 distinct modes:
			- Request
				- Processed only when user triggers device
			- Sample
				- Expects the measure to be present already at sampling time (call time)
			- Event
				- Each time a device is triggered an event is generated, placed on an event queue
	- Trigger (signal to computer that input is available and should be processed)
		- Button on mouse
		- Pressing or releasing key
## Event Categories
- Window event
- Mouse event
- Motion event
- Keyboard
- Idle
## GLUT Callbacks
- Each type of event, function is executed when event occurs
- `glutMouseFunc(mymousecallbackfunction);`
```cpp
//glutMouseFunc
//usage
void glutMouseFunc(void(*func)(int button, int state, int x, int y));

glutMouseFunc(myMouseFun);

void myMouseFun(int button, int state, int x, int y) {
	//code for what happens
}
```
- Posting Redisplays
	- Different events may need to invoke display callback function, `glutPostRedisplay();` marks that the current window needs to be redisplayed
	- GLUT checks if flag is set at end of event loop, if set then display callback function (`glutDisplayFunc(myDisplay)`) is executed

## Using a Pointing Device (Mouse)
- `glutMouseFunc()` when one mouse button is pressed, released or scroll wheel moved
- `glutMotionFunc()` when mouse moved within window with button pressed
- `glutPassiveMotionFunc()` no button while move
``` cpp
glutMoudeFunc(mymouse);

void mymouse(GLint button, GLint state, GLint x, GLint y) {
	//parameters: GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON, (middle and right as well, button == 3 is forward, 4 is back)
	//parameters state: GLUT_UP, GLUT_DOWN
	//parameters x, y: position in pixels in window, middle is (0,0), top left is GLUT(0,0) so: y_actual_coord = h - y_glut; y = (y/(h/2)) - 1.0;
	if (button == GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON && state == GLUT_DOWN) {
		exit(0); //terminate program
	}
}
```
``` cpp
//DRAW SQUARE AT CLICK LOC OF CURSOR
int h = 600; //height of window

void mymouse(int btn, int state, int x, int y) {
	if (btn == GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON && state == GLUT_DOWN) {
		exit(0);
	}
	if(btn == GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON && state == GLUT_DOWN) {
		drawSquare(x, y);
	}
}

void drawSquare(int x, int y) {
	y = h - y;
	points[i] = vec2(x+size, y+size);
	points[i+1] = vec2(x-size, y+size);
	points[i+2] = vec2(x-size, y-size);
	points[i+3] = vec2(x+size, y-size);
	i += 4;
}
```

## Keyboard Callback
``` cpp
glutKeyboardFunc(mykey);
void mykey(unsigned char key, int x, int y);
```

## Reshaping the Window
- Three possibilities:
	- Display whole world but force into window (default)
	- Display part of world
	- Alter scale to fit in window and keep aspect ratio
``` cpp
glutReshapeFunc(myreshape);
void myReshape(int w, int h){
//redisplay automativally called
	glViewPort(0,0,w, h);
	//glOrtho(left, right, top, near, far)
	glOrtho(-0.2*(float)w/(float)h,
			0.2*(float)w/(float)h,
			-0.2, 0.2, 2.0, 20.0);
```
