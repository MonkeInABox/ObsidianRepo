# Input Devices
## Pointing Devices
- Allow user to indicate a position on screen, e.g. a mouse
- **Relative Positioning**
	- Devices such as mouse, trackball and joystick return incremental inputs to OS
- **Absolute Positioning**
	- Devices such as a tablet return position directly to the OS
## Keyboard Devices
- Return character codes (ASCII code)

# Logical Input Devices
- Graphics APIs define different types of logical devices based on the kind of data the device provides
	- **Locator** is a device that provides a position in world coordinates to the user program
		- Usually a pointing device
	- **Choice** is a device that allows the user to select one of the discrete number of options
		- OpenGL can use widgets such as menus and scroll bars
	- **String** is a device that provides ASCII strings to the user program
	- **Stroke** is a device that returns an array of location
	- **Valuator** is a device that returns analogue input to the user program, such as a slide bar
	- **Pick** is a device that returns the identifier of an object on the display to the user program
# Input Modes
- Provides an input to the application program:
	- Measure (value returned to program)
		- 3 distinct modes:
			- Request
				- Processed only when user triggers device
			- Sample
				- Expects the measure to be present already at sampling time (call time)
			- Event
				- Each time a device is triggered an event is generated, placed on an event queue
	- Trigger (signal to computer that input is available and should be processed)
		- Button on mouse
		- Pressing or releasing key
## Event Categories
- Window event
- Mouse event
- Motion event
- Keyboard
- Idle
## GLUT Callbacks
- Each type of event, function is executed when event occurs
- `glutMouseFunc(mymousecallbackfunction);`
```cpp
//glutMouseFunc
//usage
void glutMouseFunc(void(*func)(int button, int state, int x, int y));

glutMouseFunc(myMouseFun);

void myMouseFun(int button, int state, int x, int y) {
	//code for what happens
}
```
- Posting Redisplays
	- Different events may need to invoke display callback function, `glutPostRedisplay();` marks that the current window needs to be redisplayed
	- GLUT checks if flag is set at end of event loop, if set then display callback function (`glutDisplayFunc(myDisplay)`) is executed
