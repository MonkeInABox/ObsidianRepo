# Polygons in OpenGL
- Graphics systems like triangles because triangles are:
	- **Simple**: edge cannot cross
	- **Convex**: all points on a line segment between two points in a polygon are also in that polygon
	- **Flat**: all vertices are in the same plane
- Recursive triangulation of convex polygon
	- For example:
		1. Start with 3 vertices and form triangle (abc points)
		2. Remove second vertex from list (remove b)
		3. Recursion: go to step 1 to form second triangle
	- Although every set of vertices can be triangulated, not all triangulation are equivalent
	- Long, thin triangles render badly
	- Equilateral triangles render well
	- To get good triangles for rendering:
		- Maximise minimum interior angle
	- *Delaunay triangulation* can be used for unstructured points

## Vertices & Attributes
- **Vertex Attributes**
	- Each data item associated with a vertex is an attribute
		- Location (x, y, z)
		- colour (r, g, b)
		- material properties, etc
	- **Colour**:
		- Each colour component is stored separately in the frame buffer
		- Occupies 8 bits per component in the buffer
		- Colour values range:
			- from 0 to 255 using unsigned integers
			- from 0.0 (none) to 1.0 (all) using floats
			- Use vec3 or vec4 to represent colour
			- `vec4 red = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);`
		- Indices into tables of RGB values (8 bits)

# Pipeline Architectures
![[Pasted image 20250304111020.png]]
- **Vertex Processing**
	- Converting object from one coordinate system to another
		- Object coordinates
		- Camera coordinates
		- Screen coordinates
	- Every change is the result of a matrix transformation
	- Can also compute vertex colours
- **Projection**
	- Combines the 3D viewer with the 3D objects to produce the 2D image
	- *Perspective Projections*: all projected rays meet at the centre of projection
	- *Parallel Projections*: projected rays are parallel; centre of projection is at infinity
- **Primitive Assembly**
	- Vertices must be collected into geometric objects before clipping and rasterisation can take place
		- Line segments
		- Polygons
		- Curves and surfaces
		are formed by the grouping of vertices in this step of the pipeline
- **Clipping**
	- Objects that are not within the volume the virtual camera can see is clipped out of the scene
	- Clipping must be done on a primitive by primitive basis
- **Rasterisation**
	- If an object is not clipped out, the appropriate pixels in the frame buffer must be assigned colours
	- Rasteriser produces a set of fragments for each object
	- Fragments are *potential pixels*. They:
		- have a location in frame buffer
		- have colour, depth, alpha, etc
- **Fragment Processing**
	- Determine colour of corresponding pixel in frame buffer
	- Determined by texture mapping or by interpolation of vertex colours
	- Fragments may be blocked by other fragments closer to camera (hidden surface removal)

## Retained Mode Graphics
- Application issues commands to update scene (add/remove shapes)
- Library responsible for redrawing
- Retained-mode API is declarative
- Immediate mode: each time a vertex is specified, its location is sent to GPU, no memory required, however, vertex creation and display must be repeated, CPU -> GPU bottleneck

```c++
// immediate mode (pseudo)
main() {
	initialize_the_system();
	p = find_initial_point();
	for (some_no_of_points) {
		q = generate_a_point(p);
		// instantly display point
		display(q);
		p = q;
	}
	cleanup();
}

// retained mode (pseudo)
main(){
	initialize_the_system();
	p = find_initial_point();
	for (some_no_of_points) {
		q = generate_a_point(p);
		// store points
		store_the_point(q);
		p = q;
	}
	// then display all points
	display_all_points();
	cleanup();
}
```
