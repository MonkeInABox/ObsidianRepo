3 Aspects, all implemented in the pipeline:
1. Positioning the camera
	- Setting the model-view matrix
2. Selecting a lens
	- Setting a projection matrix
3. Clipping
	- Setting the view volume

# The OpenGL Camera
- In OpenGL, initially the object and camera frames are the same
	- The default model-view matrix is an identity
- The camera is located at the origin and points in the negative z direction
## Moving the Camera Frame
- Frames after translation by $d$ $$T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -d \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = Translate(0.0,0.0,-d);$$
- If we want to visualise the objects that have both positive and negative z-values we can either
	- Move the objects in the negative z direction
		- Translate the world frame
	- Move the camera in the positive z direction
		- Translate the camera frame
- We can move the camera to any desired position by a sequence of rotations and translations
	- Remember the last transformation specified is first to be applied
``` cpp
//using mat.h
mat4 t = Translate(0.0, 0.0, -d);
mat4 ry = RotateY(90.0);
mat4 m = t*ry;
```
## The `LookAt()` Function
- The GLU library contains the function `gluLookAt` which can be used to form the required model-view matrix
`void gluLookAt(eyeX, eyeY, eyeZ, centreX, centreY, centreZ, upX, upY, upZ);`
- We need to define the eye (camera) position, the centre (fixation point), and an up direction, all are of part GLdouble
- Alternatively, `LookAt() from mat.h`
`mat4 mv = LookAt(vec4 eye, vec4 at, vec4 up);`

## Different View Volumes
- View volume parameters:
	- Projection: perspective, orthographic, etc.
	- Near and far clipping
	- Field of view
	- Aspect ratio
- Near plane + far plane + field of view = viewing frustum

## Default Orthographic Projection
- Default projection in the eye frame is orthogonal
- For a point $p = (x, y, z, 1)^T$ within default view volume, it is projected to $p_{p}= (x_{p}, y_{p}, z_{p}, w_{p})^T$ where $x_{p}= x, y_{p}= y, z_{p}= 0, w_{p}= 1$
$$M = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \therefore P_{p}= Mp$$

## Simple Perspective
- In perspective projection, the camera's focal length `d` is finite
- A simple perspective projection: 
	- Centre of projection is at the origin
	- Projection plane $z = d$, where $d < 0$

## Perspective Division
- Since $w = z / d \neq 1$, so we must divide by $w$ to return back to our 3D space
``` cpp
// OpenGL orthog viewing func
void glOrtho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far); // GLdouble
//alternatively Ortho() from mat.h
mat4 Ortho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far); // GLfloat
//define a persp transformation matrix for the camera
mat4 Frustum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far);
//otherwise
mat4 Perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far);
```
## Complete Viewing Pipeline
- Model (orient individual objects)
- View (orient the camera OR the entire world)
- Projection $P * V * M_{i}* O_i$
- All the `gl` etc versions have no return arguments, but the `mat.h` versions return 4 x 4 matrices of type `mat4`
## `glMatrixMode()`
- Recall that OpenGL is a state machine
- Defines the current matrix:
``` cpp
GL_MODELVIEW //from gluLookAt()
GL_PROJECTION //glOrtho(), glFrustum(), gluPerspective()
GL_TEXTURE
GL_COLOR

glGet(GL_MATRIX_MODE) //returns current matrix mode
```
