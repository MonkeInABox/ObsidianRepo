## Modules
- Control complexity, large programs broken down into functions
- As they get larger, broken into modules, these are usually in separate files
- The Python library is a large collection of modules
- `import some_module`
	- This loads **and executes** the file some_module.py
- Some common modules:
	- `math`
		- `math.pi` `math.sqrt()` etc.
		- You can select specific functions:
			- `from math import pi, sqrt`
- When you run a program, its `__name__ == __main__`
- When you ask a module for its ``__name__`` it is the module files name
	- This can be used in testing modules:
		- `if __name__ == '__main__':` as it will only run if you are running the program directly not if its being used as a module

## Parameters
- **Default parameters** allow functions to be called with different numbers of arguments
	- This reduces code repetition and helps to do one job well
	- ``def find_first(item, data, start_index = 0):`` 
		- `start_index` is a default parameter
	- Parameters without defaults *MUST* come first
- **Variable parameters** are functions that receive *any* number of arguments
	- e.g. function `max()` is: `ourMax(first, *rest):` where `*rest` is a tuple
- **Keyword arguments**: 
	- if you do not know the order:
		- for function ``def describe(age, name):`` if the user does not know the order they can instead call it with ``describe(name = "jeremy", age = 20)

## Functional Decomposition
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Functional decomposition to increase clarity and avoid repetition
- Reasons for functions:
	- to make code easier to understand
	- to make code reusable
- 2 sorts of functions:
	- Procedures: don't return a value to the caller, do print or write etc., name starts with a verb
	- Real functions: does return a value to the caller, names are nouns
- Functions arise:
	- Deliberately, from top-down design
	- During refactoring when cleaning up code
- Extracting a function:
	- Any sequence of complete statements can always be pulled out into a separate function by:
		- identifying all variables that must be defined already
		- identifying all variables that get defined or altered by the statements or are needed later
