import yadayada

phone_number = "0478634195"
print(phone_number[::-1])                          #reverses phone number

sum([1, 2, 3])                                     #returns 6

locals()                                           #returns current vars

int(3.4) == 3
float(2) == 2.0
complex(4.5) == 4.5 + 0j

round(6.433421) == 6
abs(-3) == 3
int("67") == 67
```

## DATA TYPES:
- Integers (123)
- Float (0.00)
- Complex (5+2j)
- String ("hello")
- Boolean (True/False)
```
type(123)                           #returns int
```

## OPERATORS:
 - > < == <= >= != + - / // % * ** += -=

## DEFINING FUNCTIONS:
```
def square(x):
	"""squares a number"""
	return x*x
```

## STYLE
- programming should be *correct, readable and maintainable*
- will be using PEP8
	- peps.python.org/pep-0008/
- for wide-scope variables: use only lower case, separating words with __ 
	- use clear variable names (not just x or y etc.)
- break into lots of single usage functions
- don't use global variables
- at most 40 lines per function
- at most 4 levels of indentation
- use library functions when possible
- use a main() statement to  start code
- use ALL_CAPS to define a global constant at the top of program
- separate functions 2-3 blank lines
- use white-space around o p e r a n d s
- every program must have a *docstring* at the top stating
	- author
	- role
	- date
- every function must have a *function docstring* saying what it does
	- this should be *after* the function definition
- otherwise use #comments sparingly

## Taking Inputs:
```
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("HELLO " + name + "!")
```
