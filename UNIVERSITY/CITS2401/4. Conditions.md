## Booleans:
- Either ``True`` or ``False``
- Using signs ``< > <= >= == !=``
	- Notice ``=`` is an assignment function, ``==`` is a comparative
- Also returns from ``startsWith`` etc.
- use ``is_condition`` when naming Booleans

## ``If`` Statements:
```
if boolExpression:
	block
elif boolExpression2:
	block
else:
	block
```
- NEVER compare floats for equality (cannot be guaranteed)

## Logics:
- Lazy evaluation:
	- a or b returns True if a is True; only evaluates b if a is False
	- a and b returns False if a is False; evaluates b only if a is True
	- Important if b has side effects or could generate an error
- Avoid complex logic by:
	- Simplifying logical expressions (de Morgan's, etc.)
		- ``not (a or b)`` is equal to ``not a and not b``
	- Flattening nested code
	- Introducing temporary Boolean variables
	- Writing Boolean-valued functions
