**Definite Loop**: for loop
```python
for i in [0,1,2,3,4]:
	i_sqr = i * i
	print(f"{i} squared = {i_sqr:2}")

(i * i) for i in [0,1,2,3,4]                        #returns the same
```
- Programming patterns for solving common problems:
	- accumulator
	- mapped-list (get a function of every value)
	- counting-loop
		- `for i in range(0, 7, 2):`
	- updated-list

**Indefinite Loop**: while loop


## NESTING:
- Something within something
```python
rainfalls = [
	[0,1,2,3],
	[4,5,6,7],
	[8,9,1,2]
]
```
- Need a nested loop in order to print this whole table: go through each row and print each column in each row
