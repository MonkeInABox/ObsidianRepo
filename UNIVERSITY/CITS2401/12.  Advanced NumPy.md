#### Array Broadcasting
- Allows you to perform operations on arrays with different shapes
```python
import numpy as np
#allows you to perform operations on arrays with different shapes
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
y = np.array([1, 0, -1])
#We can use broadcasting to add y to each row of x as follows:
print(x)
result = x + y.reshape(3, 1)
print(result)
```
- Broadcasting can be used to perform operations on arrays with different dimensions
```python
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
a = 2
result = a * x
print(result) [[ 2 4 6 8]
				[10 12 14 16]
				[18 20 22 24]]
```

#### Universal Functions `ufunc`
- Allows efficient element-wise operations on arrays without the need for loops or element-by-element operations
- Allows us to just `C = A + B` arrays, instead of having to loop through the arrays
