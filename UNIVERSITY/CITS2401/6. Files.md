>Specifically focused on reading files for data and statistics

## Files as Sequences
- Built in function `open(path[, mode])`
- `path` is a *filepath* string, and uses forward-slashes instead of backslashes
- `mode` is `r w a` for reading, writing and appending
- A *file object* is a sequence of lines
```
data = open("junk.txt")
for line in data:
	print(line[0:-1])
data.close()

#OR (but this uses more memory)

data = open("junk.txt")
lines = data.readlines()
for line in lines:
	print(line[0:-1])
data.close() 
```
- We can also access internet resources as files:
```
import urllib.request

url = "http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au"
web_page = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
for line in web_page:
	print(line)
web_page.close()
```

## Example Reading of Data
```
infile = open("lect07a_bubble.txt)

bubbles = []
for line in infile:
	data = line.split()    #the data is split by spaces
	bubble = float(data[3])
	bubbles.append(bubble)

print(sum(bubbles)/len(bubbles))
infile.close()

######################################################################
lect07a_bubble.txt:
1 1 2 53
3 4 5 60
2 3 5 43
```

## Extracting Data
- Need to make sure that you get the data that is actually needed, skipping any unnecessary file data
```
while line != '\n':
	pieces = line.split(',')
	date = piece[2:5]
	if pieces[5] != null:
		rainfall = float(pieces[5])
```

## Writing Files
```
out_file = open('myoutput.txt', 'w')               #create new file
data = "{0}, {1}, {2}, {2:.3f}\n"                  #explicitly us \n
out_file.write(data)
out_file.close()
```
