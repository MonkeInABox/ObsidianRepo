- The task of finding local maxima in the first derivative or zero-crossing of the second derivative
- Look for a neighbourhood with strong signs of change
- Three types:
	- Step
	- Ramp
	- Roof
## Steps in Edge Detection
1. Smoothing to get rid of noise without removing edges
2. Enhancement to enhance quality of edges (sharpening)
3. Thresholding to determine with edge pixels should be discarded as noise
4. Localisation to determine the exact edge location
## Image Gradient vs Image Derivative
- The gradient is the vector whose direction is in the direction of the maximum change of $f$ and whose magnitude is the maximum change of $f$
- Gradient is perpendicular to edge contour
- $\theta= tan^{-1}(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} / \frac{\delta f}{\delta x})$
- Change in x gives you vertical lines
	- $[1, 0, -1]$ is the x filter
- How to differentiate $F[x,y]$
	- 1. Construct a continuous image $f$ and compute derivative
	- 2. Take discrete derivative (finite difference)
	$$\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}[x, y]\approx F[x+1,y]-F[x,y]$$
- Types of discrete derivative
	- $f(x)-f(x-1)=f'(x)$ is backward = $H=[0, 1, -1]$
	- $f(x)-f(x+1)=f'(x)$ is forward = $H=[-1, 1, 0]$
	- $(f(x+1)-f(x-1))/2=f'(x)$ is central = $H=[0.5, 0, -0.5]$
- Differential Operators are operators when applied to the image return some derivatives
	- When applied, yields a new function that is the image gradient
	- Threshold this gradient to select the edge pixels

## Effects of Noise
- Finite difference filters respond strongly to noise
- Smoothing should help by forcing pixels different to neighbours to look more like neighbours
	- $g$ is the Gaussian filter

- To find edges look for peaks in $\frac{d}{dx}(f*g)=f*\frac{d}{dx}g$ (convolve)
### Derivative of Gaussian Filter

- Means x direction and y direction so yes
## Designing an Edge Detector
- Criteria for optimal edge detector:
	- Good detection: must minimise probability of false positives as well as that of false negatives
	- Good localisation: edges must be as close as possible to true edges
	- Single response: return only one point for each true edge point, minimise number of local maxima around the true edge
## Sobel Operator
- Two 3 x 3 kernels which are convolved with the individual image to calculate approximations of derivatives
- One for horizontal one for vertical
$$G_x=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 2 & 0 & -2 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}, G_y=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & -2 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
- Each of these matrices are the result of `smoothing_matrix * differentiation_matrix`
- Problems:
	- Poor localisation
	- Thresholding value favours certain directions over others
## Canny Edge Detector
- Most widely used 
1. Filter image with x, y derivatives of Gaussian
2. Find magnitude and orientation of gradient
3. Non-maximum suppression
	- Non maximum suppression is an edge thinning technique
	- Edge extracted from gradient is still quite blurred
	- Edge occurs when gradient is maxima
	- Suppress all gradient values (set to 0) except local maxima
	- Suppress non-maxima gradient even if it passes threshold
	- 
4. Thresholding and linking (hysteresis)
	- Two thresholds, high and low
		- If $<low$ not an edge
		- If $>high$ strong edge
		- Else: weak edge
## Effect of $\sigma$ 
- Large $\sigma$ detects large scale edges
- Small $\sigma$ detects fine features
