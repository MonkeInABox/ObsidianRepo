## Properties of Good Features
- Repeatability
- Salience-y
- Compactness

# Haar Features
- Feature types (similar to Haar wavelets)
- Two rectangle, three rectangle, four rectangle
- $Value = \sum(pixelsinWhite) - \sum(pixelsinBlack)$
- Computation Cost = $(N * M - 1)$ additions per pixel per filter per scale

## Integral Image
- A table that holds the sum of all pixel values to the left and top of a given pixel, inclusive
- Intermediate representation of the image
	- Sum of all pixels above and to left of $(x,y)$ in image $i$:
		- $ii(x,y)=\sum _{x'\leq x, y' \leq y} i(x',y')$
	- Computed in one pass over the image

# Feature Descriptors
- HOG: Histogram of Oriented Gradients
- SIFT: Scale Invariant Feature Transform
- SURF: Sped-Up Robust Feature

# Release the HOGs
- Focuses on the structure or shape of the object
- Provide edge direction by extracting gradient and orientation of edges
- Generates a histogram for each region separately using the gradients and orientations of pixel values
## Local Binary Pattern (LBP) Features
- Compare 8 connected neighbourhood with centre pixel
- If $pixel > centre$, replace with 1, else 0
- Construct binary number by going clockwise
- Replace centre pixel with the decimal value of binary number
- These are illumination invariant

# Harris Corner Detector
- A corner is a point around which the gradient has two or more dominant directions
- Measure of corner response:
$$R = detM- k(traceM)^{2}$$
$$detM =\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}, \space traceM=\lambda_{1}+ \lambda_{2}, \space k=const=~0.04-0.06$$
- R is large for a corner, large negative for an edge, small for flat region
- Al Gore Ithm
	1. Compute x and y derivatives $I_x$ and $I_y$ of image
	2. Compute products of derivatives
	3. For each pixel compute matrix M in local neighbourhood
	4. Compute the corner response R at each pixel
	5. Threshold R to select corners
	6. Perform non-maximum suppression

# Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
- Creates "keypoints"
	- Invariant to scaling and rotation
	- Partially to change in illumination and 3D camera viewpoint
