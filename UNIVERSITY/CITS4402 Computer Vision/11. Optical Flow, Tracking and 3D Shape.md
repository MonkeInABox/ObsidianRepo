# Optical Flow
- A movement of pixels over time
- Goal is to generate a motion vector for each pixel in an image by looking at two images
- We can track motion/flow of objects or more accurately the brightness patterns over extended periods of time
- Limited to representing apparent motion
- Represented by $I(x, y, t)$, with $u(x, y)$ horizontal and $v(x,y)$ vertical
- FORGET PHYSICS BOZO
- Have to have a small motion
- Brightness constancy, presume brightness of the point remains the same
	- $I(x+u,y+v,t+1)=I(x,y,t)$
	- $I(x(t),y(t),t) = C(constantBrightness)$
- Spatial smoothness:
	- Neighbouring pixels are likely to belong to same surface, surfaces are usually smooth, neighbouring pixels have similar flow
	- $u_{p}=u_{n}, n \in G(p)$ 
- Taylor series
	- Displacement $(\delta x, \delta y)$
	- Optical flow $(u,v)=(\frac{\partial x}{\partial t},\frac{\partial y}{\partial t})$
	- Expand a function as an infinite sum of its derivatives
- Brightness constancy equation $I_{x}u+I_{y}v+I_{t}=0$ where the $I$ is the image gradients at point p, $u,v$ are the flow directions, $I_{t}$ is the temporal gradient $=\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}$. This is the constraint equation
- We want patches with different gradients to avoid the aperture problem
- Smooth regions are bad, edges are bad, textures are good
## Lucas-Kanade Solution
- Assume for each pixel motion field and hence optical flow is constant within a small neighbourhood $W$
- $\forall points \space \space (k,l) \in W: I_{x}(k,l)u+I_{y}(k,l)v+I_{t}(k,l)=0$ 
- For a 5 x 5 image patch, we need 25 equations
- $\sum allPixelpInPatchP: A^{T}A\hat{x}=A^{T}b$
$$\begin{bmatrix} \sum _{p \in P} I_{x}I_{x} & \sum _{p \in P} I_{x}I_{y} \\ \sum _{p \in P} I_{y}I_{x} & \sum _{p \in P} I_{y}I_{y} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}=-\begin{bmatrix} \sum _{p \in P} I_{x}I_{t} \\ \sum _{p \in P} I_{y}I_{t}\end{bmatrix}$$
