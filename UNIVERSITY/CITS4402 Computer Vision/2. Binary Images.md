- Images are matrices, entries of the matrix correspond to the grey level values (range from 0 to black to 255 for white)
- Image histogram shows how many times each grey level appears in the image
- Intersection of row i and column j corresponds to a pixel location \[i,j], size of the image is related to the spatial resolution of the image
- If each grey level pixel value is represented by 8 bits (`2 x 8 = 256`), then the memory required to store a 512 x 512 image is 512 x 512 x 8
- Effect of reducing the size of an image (down sampling) aka pixelisation or block effect and effect of reducing the number of grey scale values of an image 

## Otsu Thresholding
- Converting a grey scale image to monochrome
```
g(x,y) = {1 if f(x,y) > T(x,y,p(x,y)), 0 otherwise
```
- T is global thresholding, local property `p(x,y)` is local thresholding
- Iterating through all possible threshold values and calculating a measure of spread for the pixel levels each side of the threshold
- **Otsu Algorithm**
1. Compute histogram and probabilities of each intensity level
2. Initialise class probabilities $w_{i}(0)$ and class means $\mu_{i}(0)$ 
3. Step through all possible thresholds $t=1 to 255$ 
	1. Update $w_{i}$ and $\mu_{i}$ 
	2. Compute $\sigma_{b}^{2}(t) = \sigma^{2} - \sigma_{w}^2(t)$ 
4. The value of t which gives maximum $\sigma_{b}^2(t)$ is the desired Otsu threshold

## Local Threshold
- **Niblack's** is at each pixel position determine:
	- mean in a specified region
	- standard deviation in that region
	- set local threshold to $t = \mu - 0.2\sigma$ 

## Local vs Global
- **Global**
	- Fast
	- Good results when illumination over page is uniform
	- Fail when there are local changes in illumination
- **Local**
	- Slow
	- Adapt to local changes
	- Perform well for uniform and non-uniform

## Connected Components
- $compactness = area/boundarylength^2$

## Images as Surfaces
- Same image represented as a surface
- Brightness corresponds to height on the surface
