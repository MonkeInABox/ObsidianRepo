# Image Enhancement
- Process an image so that the result is more suitable
- Methods:
	- Can be done in 
		- Spatial domain
			- Techniques based on direct manipulation of pixels
		- Frequency Domain
			- Techniques based on modifying Fourier transform
## Spatial Domain
- Point operations
	- Pixel intensity values individually
	- Does not depend on any neighbouring pixel
	- Negatives
		- Reversing intensity levels, subtracting each pixel from maximum intensity (for 8 bit: $$2^{8} - 1 = 255$$
	- Log transformations
		- Maps a narrow range of low grey level values in the input image to a wider range of output $$s=c log(r+1)$$
		- Expands values of dark pixels, compressing lower values
	- Power law (Gamma) transformations
		- Used to correct luminance $$s=cr^{\gamma} \space or \space s = c(r+\epsilon)^\gamma$$
		- $\gamma$ < 1 maps a narrow range of dark input values into a wider range of output values (increase brightness)
	- Piecewise Linear Transformation Functions
		- Contrast Stretching
			- Expands range of intensity levels
				- Multiplying by scalar, or,
				- Using Histogram equalisation, or,
				- Applying a transform that makes a dark portion darker by assigning a slope of < 1 and bright portion brighter by assigning slope of > 1
		- Grey level slicing
			- Highlighting a specific range of grey level in an image
		- Clipping
			- All intensities below Min to Min and all intensities above Max to Max
- Filter Operations
## Histogram Equalisation
- Stretch out the histogram
![[Pasted image 20250317102323.png]]
- Histograms are functions describing information extracted from image
- In a process called Histogram Equalisation (H.E.) the information is used to compute a contrast increasing intensity 
- For each intensity level, the histogram's value is equal to the number of pixels with that intensity
## Normalised Histogram Function
$$p(r_{k)}= \frac{h(r_{k})}{n} = \frac{n_k}{n}$$
- Gives a measure of how likely it is for a pixel to have a certain intensity, with the sum being 1
- Let $r_{k},k=1,2,...,m$ be the intensities of the image, with $p(r_k)$ being its normalised H.F.
- Intensity transformation function:
$$T(r_k)=\sum^k_{j=1}p(r_k)$$
- Note range of equalised image is interval [0,1]
- Method:
	![[Pasted image 20250317105700.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20250317105707.png]]
	- Divide frequencies by total number of pixels for averages
	- Compute intensity transformation function (CDFs)
	 ![[Pasted image 20250317105552.png]]
	- Multiple intensity transformation function by intensity level - 1 (by 7 because that is the maximum) and round down

# Filter (Mask) Operations
- Spatial domain filtering
	- Capabilities of point operations are limited
- Noise is any degradation in an image signal
	- Use filter to remove noise
		- Sub image is a filter or mask or kernel or window
		- Values in a filter sub image are coefficients
	- Neighbourhood Operations
		- Min: set pixel to min in neighbourhood
		- Max
		- Average
		- Median
```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

puppy = cv2.imread('puppy.jpg')

def addNoise(img):
	dst = np.empty_like(img)
	noise = cv2.randn(dst,(0,0,0),(20,20,20))
	pup_noise = cv2.addWeighted(img, 0.5, noise, 0.5, 30)

addNoise(puppy)
```
## Linear filters (Convolution filters)
- Linearity: $filter(F1+F2)=filter(F1)+filter(F2)$
- Shift invariance: same behaviour regardless of location $filter(shift(F))=shift(filter(F))$
- Commutative: $a*b=b*a$
- Associative: $a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c$
- Distributes over addition
- Scalars factor out
- Identity: $unitImpulse=e=[0,0,1,0,0]$, $a*e=a$
## Average Filtering
- Average filtering: 
	- Average all pixels in a neighbourhood
- Weighted Smoothing:
	- More effective, assigning different pixels different weights
	- Pixels closer to central pixel are more important
	- Weighted averaging
- Removes sharpness (high frequencies)
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# read image
image = cv2.imread('image.png')
# apply the 3 x 3 average filter on image
kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.float32)/9
processed_image = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, kernel)
# display image
cv2.imshow('Average Filter Processing', processed_image)
# save to disk
cv2.imwrite('processed_image.png', processed_image)
```
## Gaussian Filter
$$G_\sigma=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
- $\sigma^2$ is the width of the kernel
- $\sigma$ is the scale/width/spread of Gaussian kernel and controls amount of smoothing
```python
import cv2, numpy as np

# read im
image = cv2.imread("")
# apply 5 x 5 GF on image
processed = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5,5), 1)
# display/save
```

## Median Filter (Non Linear)
- Removes spikes (good for impulse, salt and pepper noise)
	- However, if noise is >50% then it does not work, this may happen at edges
- Not as efficient at Gaussian
## High Boost Filtering
- Here we take the image and boost high frequency components
- $highPass=OG-LowPass$
	- $HighBoost=b*OG-LowPass=(b-1)OG+HighPass$
	- $b$ is the boosting factor, when 1, HB = HP

# Anti-Aliasing
- Sample more often
- Get rid of all frequencies greater than half new SF (Nyquist frequency)
- Apply smoothing filter
