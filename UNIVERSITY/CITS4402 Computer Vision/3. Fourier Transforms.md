# Filtering
## Superposition Principle
- Additivity: $F(x_{1}+x_{2})=F(x_{1})+F(x_{2})$
- Homogeneity: scalar
## Linear and Non Linear Filtering
- Scaling of amplitude: linear
- Shift in time: linear
- Scaling of intensity: linear
- Geometric operations: linear
- Gamma correction: non-linear
## Convolution
- Convolution $(f*g)$ of two signals $f$ and $g$ is defined as the integral/sum of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted
$$(f*g) [n] = \Sigma_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}f[m]g[n-m]$$
- Convolution gives the area overlap between two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated after reversal

## Local Enhancement through Spatial Filtering
- The output intensity value at (x,y) depends not only on the input intensity value at the point, but on a specified number of neighbouring intensities
- Spatial masks are used and convolved over the entire image for local enhancement
- Size of mask determines number of neighbouring pixels influencing output value
- The values of the mask determine the nature and properties of enhancing technique
