# Filtering
## Superposition Principle
- Additivity: $F(x_{1}+x_{2})=F(x_{1})+F(x_{2})$
- Homogeneity: scalar
## Linear and Non Linear Filtering
- Scaling of amplitude: linear
- Shift in time: linear
- Scaling of intensity: linear
- Geometric operations: linear
- Gamma correction: non-linear
## Convolution
- Convolution $(f*g)$ of two signals $f$ and $g$ is defined as the integral/sum of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted
$$(f*g) [n] = \Sigma_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}f[m]g[n-m]$$
- Convolution gives the area overlap between two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated after reversal

## Local Enhancement through Spatial Filtering
- The output intensity value at (x,y) depends not only on the input intensity value at the point, but on a specified number of neighbouring intensities
- Spatial masks are used and convolved over the entire image for local enhancement
- Size of mask determines number of neighbouring pixels influencing output value
- The values of the mask determine the nature and properties of enhancing technique

## Mask Operation Near Image Border
- Problem arises:
	- Discard problem pixels
	- Zero padding (expand input image by adding padding zeros)
- Normally use grey levels of border pixels to fill up expanded region

## Spatial Filtering for Smoothing
- For blurring/noise reduction
	- Equivalent to low pass spatial filtering in frequency domain as smaller (high freq.) details are removed based on neighbourhood averaging
- The simplest form of spatial filter is a square mask with the same coefficients to preserve grey values

# Image Representation
- 2 Domains:
	- Spatial
	- Frequency
- In spatial domain, we deal with images as is, in frequency domain, we deal with the rate at which the pixel values are changing in the spatial domain, will have a spike at the frequency and negative frequency

## Applications at the Frequency Domain
- Preprocessing
	- Filtering
	- Enhancement
- Data Compression
- Feature Extraction
	- Edge Detection
	- Corner Detection

# Fourier
- Any uni variate function can be rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies
## Fourier Transform
- Used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components
- Output is Fourier or frequency domain
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) transforms spaced real signals from spatial into complex numbers in freq. domain
- DFTs are performed basically in any device which processes signals, using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
## Convolution
- Multiplication in spatial ~= convolution in frequency
	- And reverse
- Convolution is more expensive
## DFT
- Discrete Fourier Transform 1D
	- let $f(x)$ be a 1D discrete signal of $N$ samples. DFT of $f(x)$ is:
	$$F(\omega) = \Sigma_{x=0}^{N-1}f(x)e^{-i2\pi\omega x/N}$$
- Inverse:
	- let $F(\omega)$ be the DFT of a 1D signal having $N$ samples.
	$$f^{hat}(x) = \frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{\omega=0}^{N-1}F(\omega)e^{i2\pi\omega x/N}$$
- In the time domain: Sampling rate is samples/second (Hz), sampling interval is 1/sample rate, in spatial it is samples/mm for sampling rate
## Illustrations of Basis Functions
- Note about DFT:
	- The value of the transform at the origin of frequency domain at $F(0,0)$ is called the dc component
	- The values of the Fourier transform are complex
	- We visually analyse Fourier transform by computing a Fourier spectrum (magnitude of $F(u,v)$) and display as an image
- After shifting, the Fourier Spectra shows high and low, high are away from origin, low are near

# Signals
## Detecting signals
- Let $s(t)$ be a signal on $D$, then the energy of $s$ is $E:=\int_{D}|s(t)|^{2}dt$
- Physically, $s$ is a wave function and $E$ is its energy
## Correlating Signals
- Take a signal $\sigma$ with energy $E=1$
- To calculate how much $\sigma$ there is in $s$, we calculate correlation coefficient:
$$\alpha = \int\sigma(\tau)s(\tau)d\tau$$
- If $s$ is exactly $\sigma$, then $\alpha=E(\sigma)=1$
- For signals $\sigma$ of arbitrary energy, $\alpha$ is often normalised by the energy of the signal:
$$\alpha = \frac{1}{E(\sigma)}\int\sigma(\tau)s(\tau)d\tau$$
- That way, $s=\sigma$ implies $\alpha = 1$
## Cross-Correlation
- To detect phase shifted signals, we introduce a parameter $t$ to express in time:
$$\alpha = \int\sigma(t+\tau)s(\tau)d\tau$$
- This is the cross correlation between $s$ and $\sigma$
- This is a filter defined by sigma, the matched filter
- Difference between convolution and CC, CC we do not flip
## Properties of Fourier Transform
- Is linear
- Changing spatial scale inversely affects the freq. and amplitude
- Shifting only changes phase of spectrum
