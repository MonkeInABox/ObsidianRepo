## Hardware Redundancy
- Passive
	- Achieve without action
	- Do not detect fault but mask fault
	- TMR: Triple Modular Redundancy
		- 3 times hardware, majority vote, majority mask vote
		- Assume module can fail
		- What happens if the vote counter fails?
			- Simple hardware, countless times less likely to fail (bit-wise comparison)
		- Can take median value of analog sensors - called Mid-Value-Select
- Active

## Software Redundancy
- Software does not break like hardware
- Implement different independent software solutions for same problem
	- Different teams -> expensive!

## Time Redundancy
- Repeat calculation several times
- Compare results

## Information Redundancy
- Data words = contents
- Code words = transmitted information
	- Separable = contains all data plus extra
	- Non-separable
- Hamming Distance for a code:
	- `HD(code) = MIN{HD(x,y)}`
- Parity
	- Odd/even parity = HD 2

## Reliability Modelling
- Reliability $R(t)$
- Constant failure rate $\lambda$, constant repair rate $\mu$
- Reliability formula:
	- $R(t) = e^{-\lambda t}$
	- $\lambda = \frac{-1}{t} ln(R(T))$
- Mean time to failure
	- $MTTF = \int R(t) dt$
	- $MTTF = \frac{1}{\lambda}$

## Combinatorial Model 
- "Series"
	- All components must work
	- No redundancy
- "Parallel"
	- High redundancy
	- Only one must work correctly
- Calculating reliabilty:
	- With components: 0.9, 0.8, 0.7
	$$
	R_{series} = (0.9)(0.8)(0.7) = 0.504
	$$
	$$
	R_{parallel} = 1- (1-0.9)(1-0.8)(1-0.7) = 0.994
	$$
