- Manipulators are typically stationary, industrial
## Serial Robot Manipulator
- End effector is positioned by single chain of links connected by motorised joints (such as a robot arm)
## Parallel Robot Manipulator
- End effector is positioned by several serial chains (Like a Stewart platform)
## Workspace
- A reachable area of robot end effector

# Degrees of Freedom
- Many manipulators have 6 degrees of freedom, in order to reach every pose (x,y,z,$\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$) plus 1 degree of freedom for the fripper (end-effector)
- Every degree of freedom requires one joint between robot links
- Each joint can be rotational (specify angle) or prismatic (specify length)

# Manipulator Problems
### Standard Questions
- Given a set of 6 angles, what is the end-effector's pose?
	- Forward kinematics
- In order to reach a given end-effector pose, what joint angles are required?
	- Inverse kinematics
### More Complex Questions
- How can I make the end-effector follow a straight line?
	- Motion equations
- If I want the end-effector to apply a certain force, which torque do I need to supply each joint?
	- Jacobi matrix
