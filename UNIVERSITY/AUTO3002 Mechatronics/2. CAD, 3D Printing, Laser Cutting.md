## Why is CAD important
- Efficiency - able to create, modify, analyse and optimise designs
- Accuracy - provides precise measurements, angles and dimensions

## Considerations for 3D Printing
- Additive manufacturing
- Material selection
	- PLA
		- Pros: Biodegradable, from cornstarch or sugarcane, minimal odour, easy to print with
		- Cons: Relatively brittle, lower temperature resistance
	- ABS
		- Pros: High impact resistance, toughness and durability, and higher temperature resistance
		- Cons: Emits fumes, sometime warps when cooling, not biodegradable
	- PETG
		- Pros: Best of both worlds
		- Cons: Prone to stringing and oozing during printing if not properly tuned
- Geometries
- Support structures
- Surface orientation
- Tolerance and clearance
- Minimisation of material usage
- Post-processing considerations
- Parallel vs. serial printing
