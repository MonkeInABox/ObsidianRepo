# Key Considerations
- Voltage and current requirements
- Torque characteristics
- Speed range
- Power rating
- Size and weight
- Precision
- Efficiency
# Brushed DC Motors
- Pros: 
	- Simple control: direction and speed can be easily controlled by PWM signal and H bridge
	- Cost effective
	- High starting torque
- Cons: 
	- Limited speed control range compared to other types, limited efficiency at high speeds
	- Often requires motor driver
	- Needs separate power source (can't be driven by motor controller)
# Encoders
- DC motor encoders are devices used to provide feedback on the rotational position, speed and direction of DC motor's shaft
- They typically consist of a sensor that detects the motor shaft's position relative to a reference point, and a processing unit that interprets the sensor's signals
- Encoders can be either incremental or absolute:
	- Incremental provide relative position and speed information by generating a series of pulses as the motor rotates. They do not provide absolute position information without a reference point
	- Absolute encoders provide absolute position information, allowing the motor's position to be known even when power is removed and restored
# Stepper Motors
- Pros:
	- Precise positioning: stepper motors move in discrete steps, making them suitable for applications requiring accurate positioning
	- Open-loop control: no need for feedback sensors in many applications
	- High torque at low speeds
- Cons:
	- Limited maximum speed
	- Higher cost compared to DC motors
	- Power consumption even when stationary
	- Requires stepper motor driver (extra money and complexity)
# Servo Motors
- Pros:
	- Precise control: servo motors provide accurate position control through feedback mechanisms
	- High torque options
	- Wide speed range
	- Simple operation (PWM controls angle)
- Cons:
	- Higher cost compared to DC and stepper motors
	- Susceptible to issues like overshoot and hunting if not properly tuned
## Beware of continuous rotation servos
- A regular servo motor only turns over a narrow range with a PWM signal giving precise control over position
- A continuous rotation servo has a shaft that spins continuously, with a PWM signal that gives control over speed and direction
# Linear Actuators
- Convert rotational motion into linear movement using screws, belts or hydraulics
- Pros: 
	- High force output 
	- Precise control for robotic arms and grippers
- Cons:
	- Slower response compared to rotary actuators
	- Can be bulky
- **Stroke Length**
	- How far the actuator extends and retracts
- **Force (Load capacity)**
	- Measured in Newtons (N). Determines how much weight the actuator can push/pull
- **Speed**
	- Measured in mm/s. How fast the actuator extends/retracts
- **Voltage and Power Requirements**
	- Voltage required to power the internal motor
