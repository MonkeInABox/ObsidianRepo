# Key Considerations
- Voltage and current requirements
- Torque characteristics
- Speed range
- Power rating
- Size and weight
- Precision
- Efficiency
# Brushed DC Motors
- Pros: 
	- Simple control: direction and speed can be easily controlled by PWM signal and H bridge
	- Cost effective
	- High starting torque
- Cons: 
	- Limited speed control range compared to other types, limited efficiency at high speeds
	- Often requires motor driver
	- Needs separate power source (can't be driven by motor controller)
# Encoders
- DC motor encoders are devices used to provide feedback on the rotational position, speed and direction of DC motor's shaft
- They typically consist of a sensor that detects the motor shaft's position
