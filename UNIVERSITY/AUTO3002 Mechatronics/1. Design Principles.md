# Management
- Weekly Meetings
- Minutes
- Action Items

# Modularity
- Design each part separately
- Think about cabling in designing
- Plenty of time for integration
- What parts are critical?? GET SPARES

# Feedback Control
- Implement feedback control systems
- Account for drift
- PID loops for motor speed if movement
- Have a look at Unos and Megas for more pins

# Power Management
- How much power is required?
- Do all components run on the same source? (Might be a good idea not to)
- Watch for current spikes

# Reliability
- Design systems with redundancy and fail-safe systems
- What happens if one component fails?
- Reliability > Speed

# Safety
- Does your battery push up against a heat sink?
- Exposed gears, cables

# Durability
- Ensure they are robust
- FEA

# Actuators
- How many?
- How powerful?

# Prototyping
- Iterative testing
- 6mm good for major load, otherwise probably 3mm fine for MDF

# Documentation
- Every choice should have a reason, write it down
- Design Process
- Specifications
- Schematics
- Photos/Videos
- Test results
- Troubleshooting procedures
