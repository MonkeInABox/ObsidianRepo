# Actuators
- Actuators can be built in many different ways, most prominently:
	- Electrical Motors
	- Solenoids
	- Pneumatics and valves
	- Hydraulics and valves

# Motor and Encoder
- Motor speed is determined by supplied voltage
- Motor direction is determined by polarity of supplied voltage
- Cannot generate analogue power signal 
	- Use external amplifier (pulse-width modulation)
- Encoder disk is turned once for each rotor revolution
- Encoder disk can be optical or magnetic
- Single sensor can determine speed
- Dual sensors can determine speed and direction
- Using gears on motor shafts increases encoder accuracy

# H-Bridge
- Allows a motor to be driven in both directions
- Drive forward == close 1 and 2
- Drive backward == close 3 and 4

- Hardware implementation with microcontroller:
	- 2 digital output pins from microcontroller, one for switches 1 and 2, one for switches 3 and 4 feed into relays or power amplifier
	- Alternatively: use 1 digital output pin plus inverter then relays or power amplifier

# Power Amplifier Software Connection
Drive Forward
```
out1 = 1; //direction
out2 = 1; //on
```
Drive Backward
```
out1 = 0; 
out2 = 1;
```
Stop
```
out2 = 0; //off
```
Speed control = use an analogue line for enable would be good.

# D/A Converter and Pulse-Width Modulation
- Digital/Analogue Converter 
	- How can we convert a digital output into an analogue voltage
