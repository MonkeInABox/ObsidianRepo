## CPU Buses
- External ports are only possible if certain CPU signals are available on the outside (pins)

## Microcontrollers
- Microprocessor
	- CPU on a single chip
- Microcontroller
	- CPU + timers + I/O + RAM or ROM
		- Reduced chip count for board design
		- More suitable for embedded system

## I/O
- Device implementation can be:
	- Memory mapped
		- I/O device looks like regular memory cell
		- Often: addresses for control register + data register
	- I/O mapped (ports)
		- System provides special I/O ports with:
			- port addresses
			- port-commands
	- DMA (direct memory access)

## Connecting Multiple Memory Modules
- Multiple memory chips, serial access
	- Extending the address range
	- One memory chip active at any time
- Multiple memory chips, parallel access
	- Extending data width 
	- Several memory chips active at any time

## Chip Select
- 2 Methods
- Traditional: Use combinatorial circuits with CPU address lines to decode addresses
- Modern: Use CPU's chip selects, one for each chip
	- Connect chip with a CS line
	- Construct desired memory map
	- Program CS-registers at system start
