## Combinatorial Circuits
- Only logic gates, no feedback no memory
- No states
- Equivalent to mathematical function

## Sequential Circuits
- Logic gates with feedback and memory 
- States
- Equivalent to computer program

## Gates
- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR

## De Morgan's Law
NOT(A OR B) = NOT A AND NOT B
- and vice-versa
