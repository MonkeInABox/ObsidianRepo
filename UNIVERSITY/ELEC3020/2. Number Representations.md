**Decimal** = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
**Binary** = 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110...
**Hex** = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B...

## Polynomial Representation 
A position number system, each digit in their position. For example: 
(base 10 = decimal) $7412_{10} = 7 * 10^3 + 4 * 10^2 + 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^2$ 
(base 2 = binary) $1010_2 = 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0$

## Integer Conversion
### Decimal to Radix R:
```
while (number != 0):
	digit = number % R; //R is 2 for binary, 16 for hex, etc
	number = number / R;
```
>for example, 44 in hex:
>$44/16$ = 2 r C
   $2 / 16$ = 0 r 2
   therefore, 44 in hex = $2C_{16}$ 

### Binary to Hex:
Four binary digits always make up one hex digit:
e.g. `011011100`
`0101` = 5
`1100` = C
Therefore, its $5C_{16}$ 

## Fixed Point Real Numbers
Real decimal (base 10): $74.12_{10} = 7 * 10^1 + 4 * 10^0 + 1 * 10^{-1} + 2 * 10^{-2}$
Binary is just swapping the 10 with a 2, etc. 
### Decimal to Radix:
```
while (fraction != 0 && count <= precision):
	fraction = fraction * R;
	digit = trunc(fraction);
	fraction = fraction - digit;
	count++;
```
This one goes up to down, the binary value is 0.(integer part of decimal \*2)("").
Similarly, for hexadecimal, swap that 2 with a 16. 
>**TRICK**: 0.11 in binary is 0.75 as 0.1 is 0.5, 0.01 is 0.25, 0.001 is 0.125 etc.

## Signed Numbers
The highest bit indicated whether it is a negative number or not, for example with binary, a 1 in the first position is a negative, a 0 a positive or 0. It rolls over, so for example in binary with 4 digits, `0111` is 7, and -8 is `1000`, -7 is `1001` and so on. As seen, negative number range is one more than positive number range. 
2's Complement: we flip all binary numbers and increment lowest bit: 0101 -> 1010 -> 1011. 
	We do the same thing if we want to go back to signed.
You ***MUST*** keep track of where overflow occurs.

### Special Cases:
**Exponent = 0**: Fraction = 0: result = 0
			Fraction != 0: result = denormal number
**Exponent = 255**: Fraction = 0: result is +- infinity
			Fraction != 0: result is NaN
