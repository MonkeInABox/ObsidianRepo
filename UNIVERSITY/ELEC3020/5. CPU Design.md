## Function Units
**Higher level of abstraction:**
- Dealing with words (e.g. 8 bits at a time)
- One or two inputs, single output
- Outputs can be worded or single bit

## Registers
- Can have different sizes
- All bits change at the same clock signal

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- CPU = ALU + CU
	- Arithmetic logic unit
	- Control unit
- We also require: a command table and signal timing

- The Program Counter Register increments, which is then passed through to the address of the ROM, which points to data that initiates the functions. 
- CPU is constantly running, incrementing for infinite, it **cannot**  branch or loop.
- It also only calculates with constant values only, it cannot load/store data to/from the memory.
