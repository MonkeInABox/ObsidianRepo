## Function Units
**Higher level of abstraction:**
- Dealing with words (e.g. 8 bits at a time)
- One or two inputs, single output
- Outputs can be worded or single bit

## Registers
- Can have different sizes
- All bits change at the same clock signal

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- CPU = ALU + CU
	- Arithmetic logic unit
	- Control unit
- We also require: a command table and signal timing
