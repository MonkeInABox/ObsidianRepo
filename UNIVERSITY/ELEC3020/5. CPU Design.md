## Function Units
**Higher level of abstraction:**
- Dealing with words (e.g. 8 bits at a time)
- One or two inputs, single output
- Outputs can be worded or single bit

## Registers
- Can have different sizes
- All bits change at the same clock signal

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- CPU = ALU + CU
	- Arithmetic logic unit
	- Control unit
- We also require: a command table and signal timing

- The Program Counter Register increments, which is then passed through to the address of the ROM, which points to data that initiates the functions. 
- CPU is constantly running, incrementing for infinite, it **cannot**  branch or loop.
- It also only calculates with constant values only, it cannot load/store data to/from the memory.

## Another Example CPU with RAM
![[Pasted image 20240808110953.png]]
- If we want to go back one, we add FF so we go into overflow
- The multiplexer (B) the address is saved and loaded back in, fetch operand, checks RAM address
- The code register takes an OP CODE and ADDRESS, this then passes into the function block (a multiplexer)
- We can have data from the accumulator register back to RAM
- "If the acc == 0, OP CODE == 7, then the branch multiplexer is 01, so instead of being incremented by 1, its incremented by the address register"
- If OP CODE == 6, then we can write back to RAM
- Ensure code and address register don't trigger at the same time
- The data line going in and out must go to the same, however, if its not set up properly, it'll short
	- We use the tristate buffer to fix this
- Prog counter has to happen while branch is active so it can jump to a sub-routine
```
code operation
00   Acc := Acc                  NOP
01   Acc := NOT Acc              NOT
02   Acc := Acc AND Mem[Address] AND
03   Acc := Acc OR Mem[Address]  OR
04   Acc := Acc + Mem[Address]   ADD
05   Acc := Mem[Address]         LOAD (mem.)
06   Mem[Address] := Acc         STORE (mem.)
07   if Acc = 0 then PC := PC+Address BRANCH (condit.)
```
- Each command comprises of 2 bytes (command and address)
- In each timing cycle, (7 steps) PC is incremented twice: `PC := PC + 2`, except for branching
- Can load and store data in memory
- Cannot load constant values
- No unconditional branch (must clear `Acc` then conditional branch)

## Another CPU with Symmetric Opcodes
- Have commands for loading from memory AND immediate constants
- Have command for conditional branch AND unconditional branch

- OP CODEs 0 to 7 are loading memory, the rest are loading constants
- `BRA` is branch
![[Pasted image 20240808114640.png]]
- The program counter (bottom middle) changes where we are looking in RAM, we either update this by one, or via branching, we update by the address line.
- RAM outputs onto far left data line what is on the address, which it is told by the program counter
- Code Register stores our operations, which we split out the bottom three bits (as they are same for const and memory).
- The multiplexer in the top middle: the address is not really the address but data line, which can be a constant or an address, we can either say, look at this address or look at the data on the line. The line going around the "Address" is the 'constant' data line
