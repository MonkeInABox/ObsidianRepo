## Transmission Standards
#### Parallel 
- 8 bit concurrently -> parallel
- on microcontroller: use digital I/O lines or add special interface chip
- Bi-directional
- Half-duplex
- Send 8 data bits concurrently
	- Usually faster than serial transmission
- Requires additional control lines
	- Use flat ribbon cable
- Can only be over a limited distance ~1-2m
#### Serial 
- 8 bits consecutively -> serial
- on microcontroller: use 2 digital I/O lines or built in interface chip
- Bi-directional
- Full-duplex
- Send a single bit at a time
- Minimal config is 3 wires (Trans, Rec, Ground)
- Handshake
- Can be used over telephone
