## Machine Code
- Instruction format is machine-dependent
- Machine code cannot be ported
- Programming in machine code is:
	- Very low level programming
	- Difficult and error-prone
	- Not used in practice anymore
- Improvement: use name abbreviations that make sense

## Atmel Assembly Examples

OPERATION        |EXAMPLE
-----------------|--------
load from mem     LDS R16, R05
load immed(const) LDI R16, 100
load mem of X     LD R18, X+     --> + = increment X post load (or -, none)
store             ST -Y, R18     --> - = decrement Y pre load
store to data     STS R16, 100
compare with cons CPI R06, 100
add               ADD R1, R2
sub               SUB R1, R2
sub immed.        SUBI R16, 4
negation          NEG R0         --> 2s complement
increment         INC R0
decrement         DEC R0
and               AND R5, R6
or                ORI R16, 7
not (complement)  COM R4
move              MOV R5, R1
move word (2 R)   MOVW R18, R0   --> write R18 and R19 with R0 and R1
exclusive-or      EOR R5, R6
set all bits in R SER R06        --> loads $FF into register (opposite CLR)
set bits in R     SBR R06, 1     --> set nth bit to 1
clear bits in R   CBR R18, 7     --> AND with complement of n
clear             CLR R30
log. shift left   LSL R0
log. shift right  LSR R0
