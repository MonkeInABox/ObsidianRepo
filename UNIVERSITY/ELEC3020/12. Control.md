## Motor Control 
- Why?
	- Correct or wrong?
- Using a feedback control will make sure a specific value can be maintained
- Need to note: time delays, inaccuracies

## On-Off Controllers 
- Turns on or off to maintain a value
- Discrete signals
$R(t) = 1 \space if \space v_{act}(t) < v_{des}(t), \space 0 \space else$

## Proportional Controller
- Linear change of control value to reduce error
- PID controller
	- Simple, universal controller
	- Trade-offs: Response time vs. stability
	- Noise limits max. proportional gain
	- Note physical limits of actuator
