## What is JavaScript?
- A.K.A. JS
- High-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted language
- An alternative to server-side programming
	- servers are often overloaded
	- client processing is quicker
- Can interact with the internal model of the web page to alter the page dynamically

## Events:
- User's actions are referred to as *events*
- Such as mouse-clicking/interacting

## Executing JS:
- The browser: every modern browser can execute JS, however a HTML file must call the JS function
- NodeJS: a server-side JS environment, more like a traditional console (e.g. python)

## JS on the Browser:
- Several ways to include JS:
	- Inline in a tag attribute (``on click``)
	- Included in the document in the body of a ``<script>`` tag
	- From an external file referenced via a URL, using ``src`` attribute of the ``<script>`` tag

## JS I/O:
- The standard output for JavaScript embedded in a browser is the window displaying the page in which the JavaScript is embedded
- Writing logs or error messages to the document object is now considered bad practice. For simple debugging use ``console.log``
- To output information to the user, you can use the ``alert`` or ``confirm`` 
- To get input from user, you can use ``prompt``

# Basics of JavaScript
## Variables:
- variable names must start with a dollar `$` symbol, an `_` or any letter and must continue with any combination of these plus numbers. They are usually written in ``camelCase``
- Variable assignment is performed using `=`
- Variables are declared using `let`, `const`, `var` or nothing at all:
```
let z = x + y;
const x = 6;
var stopFlag = true;
zz = z;
```
- Good rule of thumb is use `let` by default

## Syntax:
`// single line comment`
```
/*
multiple
line
comment
*/
```
- Statements *should* be terminated with a `;`, however the interpreter will insert the semicolon, but you should not rely on it as it may not put it where you want

## Primitives and Objects:
- Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined
- Some object types: Function, Array, Date, Math, etc.
- Object properties are accessed by `.`
