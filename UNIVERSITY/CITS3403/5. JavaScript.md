## What is JavaScript?
- A.K.A. JS
- High-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted language
- An alternative to server-side programming
	- servers are often overloaded
	- client processing is quicker
- Can interact with the internal model of the web page to alter the page dynamically

## Events:
- User's actions are referred to as *events*
- Such as mouse-clicking/interacting

## Executing JS:
- The browser: every modern browser can execute JS, however a HTML file must call the JS function
- NodeJS: a server-side JS environment, more like a traditional console (e.g. python)

## JS on the Browser:
- Several ways to include JS:
	- Inline in a tag attribute (``on click``)
	- Included in the document in the body of a ``<script>`` tag
	- From an external file referenced via a URL, using ``src`` attribute of the ``<script>`` tag
