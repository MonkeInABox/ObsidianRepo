>An *Application Programming Interface* (API) is a means to provide the logic and data structures of your app as a service to other developers so they can embed the functionality into different applications and customise the UI

The most common API design is based on REST APIs, client-side page rendering uses what are essentially REST APIs designed for private rather than public use

### Principles of REST
- **REpresentational State Transfer** (REST) is an architecture for the web that describe interactions with web-based resources
#### The 6 Characteristics of REST
1. Client-server model: sets out different roles of the client and server in the system, should be clearly differentiated as separate processes, the interface is through HTTP and the transport through TCP/IP
2. Layered System: there does not need to be a direct link between the client and the server, the client does not need to distinguish between the actual server and an intermediary, and the server does not need to know whether it is communicating directly with the client
3. Cache: states that it is acceptable for the client or intermediaries to cache responses to requests and serve these without going back to the server every time. This allows for efficient operations of the web. Anything encrypted cannot be cached by an intermediary, saves reloading the same static files.
4. Code on Demand (Optional): can provide executable code in responses to a client
5. Stateless: servers should not maintain any memory of prior transactions and every request from clients should include sufficient context for the server to satisfy the request
6. Uniform Interface: clients in principle do not need to be specifically designed to consume a server

### Designing a REST API
- Standard CRUD operations are CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE, typical ways to interact with our data model
- In web apps, they are mapped to HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH and DELETE

### REST in Flask
- Can augment a Flask web app so that it provides a REST API but shares the database with the web app
- The REST API provides a web interface to the backend data model
- Flask application looks like:
```
myapp\
	app\
		__init__.py
		FORMS.py
		models.py
		controllers.py
		routes.py
		templates\
			base.html
			...
		static\
			bootstrap.css
			...
		api\
			__init__.py              //initialise the api
			auth.py                  //handle token based auth
			models_api.py            //handle api routes for each model
			token_api.py             //handles tokens
```
- **TOKENS**: access to many APIs are controlled by tokens, the token API allows a logged-in user to generate a token that allows access to the API
