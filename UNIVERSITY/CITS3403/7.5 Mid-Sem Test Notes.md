## The WWW, the Internet and YOU!
The WWW are the pages that you see on the device when you are online, and the internet is the network of computers that the WWW works on and travels across

## HTML & CSS
HTML is a markup language (specifies structure and formatting of a document and the relations between its parts) that is used to provide the content for a webpage, CSS is used to style that content, by taking the components of the HTML code and specifying the presentation of it. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>Page Title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Heading</h1>
		<p>Paragraph</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="1">...</table>
		<!-----COMMENT------>
	</body>
</html>
```
```css
body {
	backgroudn-color: blue;
	color: white;
	text-align: center;
	font-family: verdana;
	font-size: 20px;
}
```
Using both HTML and CSS separately improves the modularity of a website as, having a designated style sheet, providing the ability to apply a consistent presentation among many HTML documents. It also improves the maintainability as if something needs to be changed, it can just be changed in the one style sheet and will be applied to all other documents cutting down development time significantly.

Using CSS to layout a web-page: 
- You can use position property group to determine how an element interacts with elements around it:
	- static = go with normal
	- relative = element is offset relative to its normal flow position
	- absolute = element is offset relative to its most recently positioned ancestor. Element is removed entirely from normal flow
	- fixed = element offset relative to the fixed viewport
	- sticky = switches between relative and fixed depending on scroll position
- The box-model:
![[Pasted image 20240406115501.png]]
CSS Selectors:
```css
*{...} UNIVERSAL
p{...} ELEMENT
.important{...} CLASS
.important:hover{...} PSEUDO-CLASS
important::first-letter{...} PSEUDO-ELEMENT
s1,s2,s3{...} GROUP
```


## JavaScript
High-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted language
- An alternative to server-side programming
	- servers are often overloaded
	- client processing is quicker
- Can interact with the internal model of the web page to alter the page dynamically
```js
//check if the same number of opening and closing brackets
function parenthesisMatch(code) {
	let number = 0;
	for (let char of code){
		if(char == '(') {
			number++;
		}
		if(char == ')') {
			number--;
		}
	}
	if (number == 0) {
		console.log("Correct Number!");
	}
	else {
		console.log("Incorrect Number!")
	}
}

const line = prompt("Enter line of code: ");
const parenthesisMatch = check(code);


//swap one word with another when specified
//insert HTML here
<section id="text">
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
</section>

<input type="text" id="find" placeHolder="Find this text">
<input type="text" id="swap" placeHolder="Swap with this">
<button onclick="replaceText()">Replace</button>

<script>
function replaceText() {
	var find = document.getElementById("find").value;
	var swap = document.getElementById("swap").value;
	var section = document.getElementById("text");
	var paras = section.getElementByTagName("p");

	for (var i = 0; i < paras.length; i++) {
		var para = paras[i];
		var totalText = paragraph.textContent;
		var newText = text.replace(totalText, find, swap)
		para.textContent = newText
	}
}
</script>
```
How is JavaScript **Prototype Based**?
- Prototype based programming is when classes are not explicitly defined, you create an object by reusing another objects properties

## DOM 
Document Object Model
Is a platform and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update content, structure and style of documents
