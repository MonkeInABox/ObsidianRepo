## The WWW, the Internet and YOU!


## HTML & CSS
HTML is a markup language that is used to provide the content for a webpage, CSS is used to style that content, by taking the components of the HTML code and specifying the presentation of it. 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>Page Title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Heading</h1>
		<p>Paragraph</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="1">...</table>
		<!-----COMMENT------>
	</body>
</html>
```
```
body {
	backgroudn-color: blue;
	color: white;
	text-align: center;
	font-family: verdana;
	font-size: 20px;
}
```
Using both HTML and CSS separately improves the modularity of a website as, having a designated style sheet, providing the ability to apply a consistent presentation among many HTML documents. It also improves the maintainability as if something needs to be changed, it can just be changed in the one style sheet and will be applied to all other documents cutting down development time significantly.

## JavaScript
High-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted language
- An alternative to server-side programming
	- servers are often overloaded
	- client processing is quicker
- Can interact with the internal model of the web page to alter the page dynamically
```
//check if the same number of opening and closing brackets
function parenthesisMatch(code) {
	let number = 0;
	for (let char of code){
		if(char == '(') {
			number++;
		}
		if(char == ')') {
			number--;
		}
	}
	if (number == 0) {
		console.log("Correct Number!");
	}
	else {
		console.log("Incorrect Number!")
	}
}

const line = prompt("Enter line of code: ");
const parenthesisMatch = check(code);
```

## DOM 
Document Object Model
Is a platform and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update content, structure and style of documents
