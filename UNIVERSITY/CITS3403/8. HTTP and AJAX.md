## HTTP Requests
#### Structure of HTTP Requests and Responses
- Updating when something happens on a server (a message is sent in a forum, submitting a form, etc.)
- Client-server-architecture: Client sends a HTTP request to a server, server receives request, formulates and sends a response, protocol becomes once again stateless.
- Methods include:
	- GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE
- This is included in the request, as long with the URL and message body
- A response reports the status (200 == OK, 404 file not found), a header and message body
```js
//GET requests
xhttp.open("GET", "demo_get2.asp?fname=Henry&lname=Ford", true); //true is whether its asynchronous
xhttp.send();

//POST requests
xhttp.open("POST", "ajax_test.asp", true);
xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhttp.send("fname=Henry&lname=Ford");

//PUT request to replace data on server

//readystate is the progress of req, onreadystatechange is a callback func
function loadDoc() {
	var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
		if (this.readystate == 4 && this.status == 200) { //status == OK
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHRML = this.responseText;
		}
	};
	xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
	xhttp.send();
}
```
#### Asynchronous Communication
- We do not know when/if the server will respond
- JavaScript is single-threaded so must run each statement in order, but the environment that JavaScript runs in is not single-threaded, so we can write a function with a function as the parameter
#### XMLHttpRequests
- Modern browsers have this object to handle requests to and responses from a server
#### jQuery and HTTP Requests
- jQuery `get` function will send a GET request to a URL and passes the data to a callback function.
```js
$("button").click(function() {
	$.post("demo_test_post.asp", fucntion(data, status){
		alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
	});
});
```
- jQuery `post` function will send a POST request, with data to a URL and passes the response to a callback function.
```js
$("button").click(function() {
	$.post("demo_test_post.asp",
	{
		name: "Donald Duck",
		city: "Duckburg"
	},
	function(data, status) {
		alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
	});
});
```

## AJAX
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- A protocol for what information should be sent
- For JS to communicate directly with a server, we require a format, which is usually XML and JSON
- XML:
	- All data is held within tags, much like HTML
- JSON: 
	- stores data in the syntax of JS
