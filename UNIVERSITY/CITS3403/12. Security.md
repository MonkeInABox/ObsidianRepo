#### Breakdown
- Security on the web depends on trust. There are several elements to this:
	1. The web server needs to be confident that someone accessing data is authorised
		- Achieved via session/token-based authentication
	2. The user needs to know that the site they are visiting is the one they intend to
		- Achieved via SSL Certificates
	3. Both the server and the client need to be confident that no one in the middle is accessing unauthorised data
		- Achieved via HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
	- Underlying all of these are public-key encryption and cryptographic hashing

#### Public Key Encryption
- Secure communication is based on Public Key Encryption. There is an encryption and decryption function
- A public-private key is a pair of keys `pub` and `priv` such that
	$x = D_{priv}E_{pub}(x)$      $x = D_{pub}E_{priv}(x)$
	you cannot work out `priv` even if you know `pub`
- "Salting" is added to each user, differently, so that the hash cannot be computed via a rainbow table

#### Hashing
- Secure data storage is based on Cryptographic Hashing
	- A cryptographic hash function is a function hash that takes a string or arbitrary length and returns a fixed length integer such that:
	- Essentially it computes a number from a stream of data, in such a way that it's very difficult to fabricate data with a certain hash
	- Related to hashing for hash tables, but the hash function must satisfy the much stronger properties above to be cryptographically secure

#### Session-based User Authentication
- HTTP is stateless, application is not!
- To track a user's session, we need to have them register so we can associate a username and password with them. The password is hashed, and the result is stored in the database
- When someone logs in, they provide the same password
- If successful, the server's response contains a cookie with the session ID and hash
- Whenever a future HTTP request is made, the server checks the session ID in the cookie and recomputes hash to check the ID hasn't been altered

## Attacks on Session Based Protocols
#### Impersonation Attack
- Sessions allow the server to authenticate the user. However, remember the network is still fundamentally insecure
- Without extra security, the easiest attack is an impersonation attack
	- The network redirected the user's request to a fake user
	- The fake server acts just like the real server
	- User submits passwords, private data etc. to the fake server

#### SSL Certificates
- An impersonation attack can be prevented by the server a certificate that it's real via the Secure Socket Layer protocol
- Certificates are provided by a trusted third party known as a Certificate Authority (CA)

#### Man-in-the-middle Attack
- Even when using certificates, the network can still perform man-in-the-middle attacks
	- All traffic is first redirected to the attacker and then forwarded to the real server
	- Because the user is interacting with the real server, the certificate check passes
	- However, the attacker still gets access to all the information sent back and forth, including the signed cookies

#### Encrypted Sessions With SSL
- We cannot prevent the network from redirecting the messages via a third party, so we must encrypt our messages
- SSL also includes a public key encryption process to enable secure HTTP requests
- After the initial certificate handshake establishing that the server has the public key, both parties use a key distribution protocol to generate a shared set of private session keys
- They then use these keys to encrypt all future traffic during that session

#### HTTPS 
- In theory SSL can be used to encrypt any data between two end points
- In practice, the most common type of traffic is simply HTTP requests. Using HTTP over SSL is known as HTTPS

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CRSF) Attack
- A signed cookie from their server in your browser:
	- Cookies are transferred automatically when making the request to the domain they are associated with, and therefore the signed cookie is sent to the server
	- The server checks the cookie, which passes as it is real, and therefore thinks the request is from the user and the transfer goes through

## Token-Based User Authentication
#### Downsides of Session-Based Authentication
- Session-based authentication works for web-based applications but has several drawbacks
	- It requires the application to track all user sessions which may not scale well
	- HTTP requests are sent in plain text, and passwords should never be transmitted or stored in plain text
	- The user may be accessing the application via a mobile application where there is no such thing as a cookie
	- It is inherently stateful, which may not be necessary
	- It requires users to have registered their information with the server

#### Tokens and JWT
- From a cryptographic perspective, tokens are the same as session cookies, but unlike session cookies, tokens are not usually used to authenticate a user and retrieve the state on the server
- Instead, they authorise the holder to perform a particular action
- Crucially, it is not necessary for the server to know who the requester is

#### Advantages of Tokens
- By sacrificing the ability to store state, tokens have many advantages over sessions:
	- Validating a token doesn't require querying the database
	- Tokens aren't vulnerable to CRSF attacks
	- They don't require cookies and therefore work on mobile apps
	- Tokens can store a set of privileges, rather than just one
