### BOAC Flight 781 Crash
**What Happened?**

**Stress Concentration**
- Round vs. Square
	- The bigger the radius of rounding of the angles of the curvilinear square (the closer the shape to the circle), the less stress intensity factor.
	- Maximum stress concentration occurs near the angles of the square
	- As the radius of rounding of the angles gets smaller, the concentration of stresses near the hole increases greatly
- Elliptical vs. Round
	- Vertically elongated elliptical holes are the best shape as they have a lower stress intensity factor
$$ \sigma_{\theta \theta} = \sigma_{0} (1-2cos(2\theta)) $$
- Where $\sigma_{\theta}$ is the stresses at the contour of the round hole and $\sigma_{0}$ is the uniaxial stress applied

### Hyatt Walkway Collapse
![[Pasted image 20240521132419.png]]
**Conclusion**
- In the original design, the beams of the fourth floor walkway only had to support the weight of the fourth floor walkway, the second floor supported completely by the rods, in the revised design, the fourth floor beams supported both the fourth floor and the second floor hanging from it. They bolts were also put through the welded section, being the weakest section. 

### Formula One Car (Torsion)
- *What properties should a material have to be suitable for F1 car?*
	- Material should be stiff, light and strong, car corners should be stiff and rigid rather than flexible (car response better, torque is transmitted more efficiently). A light car accelerates and brakes more quickly. Strong car protects the driver. 
- *Who first used carbon fibre?*
	- 40 years ago, aerospace wing of Rolls Royce, used for high-speed fan blades in their jet engine, as they had to be very light and strong.
- *What components of F1 car are made from carbon fibre?*
	- Drive and prop shafts.
- *Difference between mechanical behaviour between steel rods and carbon fibre shafts?*
	- Tested in torsion. The steel shaft fails earlier in torsion. Steel is ductile, failed in buckling, folding at 45 degrees.
- When a circular shaft is subjected to torsion, shear stresses act over the cross sections and on longitudinal planes
- *What pros and cons of using carbon fibres?*
	- Carbon fibre is a stiff, light and strong material, but very expensive.


### Troll A Platform
- *What is Troll  A?*
	- A platform off the coast of Norway, as of 2014 it was the tallest structure ever moved to another position. The legs were built to be one continuous pillar of concrete with no joints. This increases its ability to withstand stress as there are no concentrated points for stress to occur. The waves are the main stress source for the platform, therefore its a cyclic load. Steel reinforcements are used to minimise the movement of the concrete pillars, as concrete is only really strong under compression, so the steel aids in reinforcing the pillars when they are having a sideways force applied to them. To address resonance, the pillars are split with a big block some way up that reduces the amount that the pillars can vibrate at a certain frequency that the waves would never reach.

### LNG Tank
- LNG carriers are equipped with spherical tanks that are 30 to 40m in diameter and made of thin aluminium alloy. They have thermal insulation features. The tanks are welded using the most reliable butt-welding methods, which can be inspected using x-rays and ultrasonic testing in order to ensure perfect welding.
