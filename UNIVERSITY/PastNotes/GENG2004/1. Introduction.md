Stress **σ**
Strain **ε**

The max force a structure can withstand will vary with geometry and is not a material constant:
$$
σ_{max} \le σ_{ultimate}/n
$$
$$
MarginOfSafety = n-1
$$

## Assumptions adopted in the discipline to ensure analysis is valid:
1. Continuity - deformable body is continuous (without fractures)
2. Homogeneity - Material properties are the same at all points
3. Isotropy - Material properties are the same in all directions
4. In the geometries considered at least one dimension is much smaller than the others

## Axial Loading: Normal Stress:
$$
σ_{average} = P/(diameter_{objectA}*diameter_{objectB})
$$

## Axial Loading: Shear Stress:
$$
𝜏_{average}=P/A
$$
- where A is the cross-sectional area being sheared and P is the force applied
