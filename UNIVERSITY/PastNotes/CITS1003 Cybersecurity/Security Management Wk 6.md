The overall process for managing security risk within an organisation, several standards set out the process (accreditation and certifications).

Security Requirements from 3 Sources:

- information security risks based on the organisations business

- legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations

- principles, objectives and business requirements for information processing that an organisation has developed to support its operations

Security policies outlines an organisations approach to security through a set of policies that cover many things

Assessing risk:

- qualitative
    
    - focus groups, surveys
    
    - can help communicate risks but cannot be used to prioritise which risk to handle first

- quantitative
    - asset valuation, exposure factor, single loss expectancy, cost/benefit etc.

FAIR:

- Factor Analysis Information Risk

- quantitative

- in percentages

- controls aim to reduce frequency or magnitude

Controls:

- Types
    
    - Physical
        - CCTV, lock systems, swipe cards
    
    - Technical
        - encryption, firewalls
    
    - Administrative
        - policies, procedures, hiring, training

- Functions
    
    - Preventative
        - fences, warnings, alarms
    
    - Detective
        - audit trails, logging, CCTV, honeypots
    
    - Corrective
    

Security operations

- need to know and least privilege

- separation of duties and responsibilities

- two-person control

- privileged account management

- change management

- personnel security

- information management lifecycle

- hardware and software

Attack Tree:

- Root node: describes the goal

- Child node: represents a sub goal or an attack step for overall goal

- leaf node: refers to an attack step and has not child node

Attack Modelling:

- a structured approach to creating a security model of a given system

- used to identify, assess and prioritise partial threats to an organisations information systems

- two methodologies:
    
    - DREAD
        
        - used for a specific threat
        
        - damage potential, reproducibility, exploitability, affected users, discoverability
    
    - STRIDE
        
        - used to identify and categorise all threats, then use DREAD
        
        - spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege

- probability of occurrence

- potential impact

- ease of mitigation

- compliance requirements
