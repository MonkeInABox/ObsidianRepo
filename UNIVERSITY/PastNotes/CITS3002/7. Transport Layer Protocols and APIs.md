#### Port Numbers
- IP addresses only address hosts and not individual OS processes on those hosts
- From the perspective of any transport protocol, such as TCP, each frame is identified by a 16bit positive port number that identifies the software end point
- TCP demultiplexes each arriving segment to its corresponding end point, using a port as an index
- Port numbers under 1024 are *reserved ports*, can be shown on Linux by `/etc/services`

#### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Transforms raw IP into full duplex reliable character stream
- Uses sliding window with selective-repeat protocol and conveys a number of important fields in its TCP frame header
- **6 Major Features**:
	1. Connection Orientation (one program must first request a connection)
	2. Reliable Connection Start-up (when two apps create a connection, they must both agree)
	3. Point to Point Communication (each communication session has exactly two end points)
	4. Full-Duplex Communication (single connection may be used for messages in both directions)
	5. Stream Interface (from applications view, data is sent and received as a continuous sequence of bytes)
	6. Graceful Connection Shutdown (TCP/IP guarantees to reliable deliver all pending data once a connection is closed by an endpoint)

#### TCP/IP Transmissions
- Due to massively variable distances
- Sliding window protocol and timeouts are employed to force re-transmissions, however as the distance can vary these must vary as well
- Therefore we use the equation:
  $SRTT = (\alpha * SRTT) + ((1 - \alpha) * RTT)$
	  RTT = estimate of current round trip time for each connection
	  SRTT = smoothed round trip time, minimising effects
	  $\alpha$ = the smoothing factor (1 when the new value of RTT is ignored)'
- SRTT estimates the average round trip time

#### TCP/IP Congestion Control
- TCP attempts to avoid congestion collapse by using end to end packet loss as a measure of congestion
	- TCP receiver *fills* the Window field of an ACK header to report how much additional buffer space is available for further data
	- When a message is lost, the TCP sender could naively retransmit, instead it commences by sending a single packet, if ACK, then it transmits two, then four, etc... 
	- TCP/IP responds to congestion by backing off quickly and avoids further congestion by slowly increasing offered traffic

#### Network Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
- Calls to Unix `open()` which can then be `read()` and `write()`
- It is preferable if the API to network I/O exhibit the same semantics as file or stream, however this is difficult:
	- client-server asymmetry
	- network connections may be connection oriented or connectionless
	- Identification is more important to network than for file operations
	- Many I/O models presume continuous data stream

#### Berkeley Sockets (a network API)
- Consists of 3 parts:
	- Socket layer provides the interface between user programs and networking
	- Protocol layer supports different protocols in use (TCP/IP, etc.)
	- The device driver supports physical devices (ethernet controllers, etc.)
