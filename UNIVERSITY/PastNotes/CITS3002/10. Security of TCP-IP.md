The 4 layers of the TCP/IP suite, has multiple potential vulnerabilities:
- **Application Layer**: such as FTP, HTTP and SMTP run on machines to which attackers may not otherwise have physical access. Each application service may need to authenticate its remote client, and may use local OS authentication to perform this. Individual applications offering the networked services are themselves also vulnerable
- **Transport Layer**: primarily provided by the reliable, streaming transport control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP) meet the data delivery requirements of most internet applications, however, apps and OSs expect the protocol to perform in certain ways, so incorrect interpretation of protocol, or attacks makes them not work as expected or at all. 
- **Internet Layer**: consists of the Internet Protocol (IP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) provide the actual routed delivery of messages between source and destination. IPv4 is particularly vulnerable to attack and may be exploited to not deliver messages, or deliver to the wrong destination, etc. 
- **Physical Layer**: are not strictly part of the TCP/IP suite, but define how packets or frames are received via hardware and provided to the IP layer above. By its nature, interface hardware must see all packets destined for the interface. 

### Packet Sniffing
- Most computer networks consist of many personal computers or workstations connected via a shared LAN or WLAN segments. To capture the information traversing the network is termed sniffing. LAN topology, specifically Ethernet, works by transmitting addressed packets via shared cable. 
- Two main problems with Ethernet's approach:
	- Most Ethernet NICs (network interface card) can be placed in promiscuous mode, which results in all observed packets being sent to the OS
	- Most Ethernet NICs permit their NIC address to be modified, so one Ethernet NIC could be given the MAC address of another
- A variety of hardware and software tools are termed packet sniffers:
	- Packet sniffer denotes any hardware or software tool that can capture packets from a network
	- Network analysers are tools that monitor network traffic and devices with the goal of alerting the network manager of problems
	- Protocol analysers are tools that capture network packets, providing some level of formatting for those packets, allowing the user to analyse/visualise packets post-hoc
- Typical uses of such programs:
	- Automatic sifting of clear-text passwords and usernames
	- Conversion of data to human readable format so that people can read the traffic
	- Fault analysis to discover problems in the network
	- Network intrusion detection
	- Network traffic logging

### TCP/IP Port Scanning
- An attacker tries to identify which services are supported from a potential target host. 
- Can connect to an open port.

### Stealth Port Scanning
- Involves searching for open ports, but without actually creating a connection, nothing is logged by half-open scanning. 

### IP Spoofing
- Allows an intruder on the internet to effectively impersonate a local system's IP address. 
- Create and send malformed IP packets.

### UDP Packet Spoofing
- UDP is a lightweight protocol built on IP. An attacker may attack a UDP service because of these properties - the attacker is unconcerned about reply packets. 

### DoS Attacks
- Using source address spoofing to send thousands of packets to a target system, characterised by attackers' explicit attempt to prevent or delay legitimate users from using a service
#### Smurf DDoS Attack
- The attacker provides a spoofed source address, when sending an ICMP echo, or ping, to an IP broadcast address as the destination.

### Security at Network Boundaries
- The greatest opportunity is provided to an attacker who connects to the LAN from the wider internet.
- Attacks from the internet can attempt to bypass the user or system-level security of a single machine, or possibly undertake a DoS attack on the LAN itself. 
- Specifically we should:
	- Control network traffic based on both senders' and receivers' network IP address
	- Control network traffic based on requested services (IP Ports)
	- Not expose our LAN topology to the wider-internet, hiding hostnames, addresses and available services
	- Constrain some network traffic based on its content
	- Only permit internal access from remote users and services, based on their verified identities and possibly location
	- Log all internet connections, attempts and traffic

### Packet Filtering at Network Boundaries
- *Firewall* describes any network device, appliance or specially configured computer which protects the boundary of an internal network. 
- A firewall may be:
	- part of a traditional single workstation protecting itself
	- a computer or device protecting several other workstations
	- a dedicated device doing nothing else but protecting other hosts

#### Possible Packet Filtering Criteria
- By examining the headers of TCP/IP traffic, we can detect obviously falsified traffic:
	- filter on each IP packet's source address
		- i.e. a packet arriving outside out internal network and announce their source address as being internal, has probably spoofed source addresses
	- filter on each IP packet's destination address
	- filter based in specific low level routing or transport protocols
	- filter based on application protocols
		- i.e. letting HTTP and FTP requests leave, but not NFS to enter
	- filter based on recent activity

### Developing a Firewall Policy
- Simplifies and provides a consistent and consistently applied practice deciding what traffic to permit and what to filter

### `iptables`
- State-of-the-art in programmable firewall software, provides stateful control over network traffic
- Consists of two software components:
	- `iptables` application program, controlling the set of rules and policies to be enforced
	- `netfilter` software configured as part of an OS kernel to control IP traffic on several network interfaces
- Lifetime of a packet as it enters and traverses a firewall:
	- the packet could have originated on the firewall host and be destined for another host, `iptables` filters these packets before they are retransmitted
	- the packet could have originated from outside the firewall host and be destined for processes on the firewall host
	- the packet could have been originated from outside the firewall host and be destined for another host, `iptables` filters these packets as soon as the packet arrives via an incoming interface

### IP Masquerading or Network Address Translation (NAT)
- A technique employed within a firewall or border gateway to translate one set of IP address to another
- Primary motivations for NAT are:
	- your network provider may only provide you with a single IP address to use
	- it simplifies the later growth and redesign of a network
	- external attackers cannot learn the topology of your internal network unless they penetrate your firewall

### Connection Tracking
- The ability for a firewall to maintain state information about connections - source and destination IP address and port number pairs, protocol types, connection state and timeouts
- Firewalls able to do this are termed stateful
