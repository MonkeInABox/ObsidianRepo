#### TCP/IP Protocol Layers & Common Protocols
- Application | Telnet, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP
- Transport | TCP, UDP
- Internet/Network | ARP, IP, IGMP, ICMP
- Link (can also be referred to as the data link and physical layers) | Ethernet, ATM

#### Requirements of Internetworking
- Networks come in different topologies and speeds, so no single network configuration suits everyone
- Internetworking draws the multitudes of networking technologies into a common framework, combining networks into internets
- In general, an internetwork must: 
	- Provide a link between networks
	- Provide routing and delivery of data
	- Provide an accounting service, keeping track of the status of networks and gateways
	- Accommodate the differences between sub-networks

#### Initial Internet Concepts
**Ground Rules**:
- Each distinct networks would have to stand on its own
- Communications would be on a best effort basis (if a packet doesn't make it to a final destination, it would shortly be retransmitted)
- Black boxes would be used to connect the networks, later called gateways, that hold no information from packets passing through
- No global control at the operations level
**Key Issues**:
- Algorithms to prevent lost packets from permanently disabling communications
- Providing for host to host pipelining
- Gateway functions to allow it to forward packets appropriately
- Need for end-end checksums, reassembly of packets and detection of duplicates
- Need for global addressing
- Test for host-to-host flow control
- Interfacing with various OSs
**Emergent Basic Approaches**:
- Communications consist of a very long streams of bytes (octets)
- Flow control done by sliding windows and acknowledgements
- 32 bit IP address used (8 bits signified network, 24 bits designated the host)

#### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Low level protocol that hides the underlying physical addressing, permitting one or more internet addresses to be assigned to each machine
- Its design permits it to indicate how big its own fields will be

#### Configuration of Network Devices
- To configure its own network connection, a client host requires:
	- One unique IP address for each network interface
	- The client's hostname
	- Address of default router
	- Each interface's subnet mask (determines how many bits of the IP address provide the network and host ids)
	- IP address of an initial DNS (domain name server)
	- The time, or at least the time zone

#### Problems with Static Configuration
- Sys admins may have to oversee hundreds of machines on a network
- Single network domain may service many more computers than it has registered IP addresses
- Mobile computers may wish to frequently connect to different networks
- Some previously trusted computers may become untrusted

#### Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
- UDP/IP based protocol that allows a booting host to configure itself dynamically
- A server's BOOTP response includes several configuration items and fits in a single (Ethernet) packet
- Immediately boot up and asks through their MAC address what they should be (addresses, IPs, etc.)

#### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Enables individual computers on an IP network to extract their configurations from a server
- Responses to each client will be generated dynamically
- Overall purpose being to reduce the work necessary to administer a large IP-based network
- Based on BOOTP, however DHCP allows for dynamic allocation of network addresses and configurations to newly attached hosts

#### Internet Protocol (IP) Datagrams
- Provides an unreliable, best-effort, connectionless, packet delivery system
- We will primarily use IP v4
- Internet datagrams resemble standard physical layer frames, but are designed to be encapsulated within the normal network framing schema

#### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Allows gateways and hosts to exchange bootstrap and error information
- Gateways send ICMP datagrams when they cannot deliver a datagram, or to direct hosts to use another gateway
