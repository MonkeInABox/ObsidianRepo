# O(1): 
 - Constant, executes same amount of time regardless of size
 - Extracting data from an element, hashing

# O(logN):
- Logarithmic, halves data set in each pass
- Binary Search

# O(N):
- Linear, grows with data set
- Looping through a single dimension array, linear search

# O(NlogN):
- Linearithmic, quick sort, merge sort, divide data set, solved concurrently on divided lists

# O(N$^2$):
- Proportional to square, number of loops, bubble sort

# O(2$^N$):
- Exponential, doubles with each addition to the data set in each pass
- Fibonacci. Recursive functions with two calls.
- C is the number of branches in a decision tree
