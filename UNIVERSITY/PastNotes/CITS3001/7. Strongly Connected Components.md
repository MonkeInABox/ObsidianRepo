## DFS Discovery and Finishing Times
- A DFS can be either preorder or postorder 
- In preorder traversal we visit a node before any of its children
- In postorder we visit a node after all its descendants
- The discovery time of a vertex $d(v)$ is the index of its first appearance in this ordering, and likewise its finishing time $f(v)$ is the index of its second appearance
``` python
def dfs_times(adjlist: list[list[int]], root=0) -> (list[int], list[int]):
	discovery = [None for _ in adjlist]
	finishing = [None for _ in adjlist]
	time = 0
	def dfs(current: int):
		nonlocal time
		if discovery[current] is None:
			discovery[current] = time
			time += 1
			for neighbour in adjlist[current]:
				dfs(neighbour)
			finishing[current] = time
			time += 1
	dfs(root)
```

## Reachability
- We say $v$ is reachable from $u$ iff there exists a path in $G$ that starts at $u$ and ends at $v$
- In a directed graph, reachability is not necessarily symmetric

## Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
- Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex
- A strongly connected component is a vertex induced subgraph that is a strongly connected graph, with no vertex $u$ outside the component c=that can reach and is reachable.
- This means there are no cycles between strongly connected components. 
- SCCs of $G^T$ will be the same as $G$.

Where $\{\{a,b,e\},\{c,d,h\},\{f,g\}\}$ are strongly connected components.

### Naïve Algorithm
- Pick vertex $u$, make it a SCC
- DFS to find every vertex $v$ that $u$ can reach
- DFS from each $v$ to check if it can reach $u$, adding to $u$'s SCC if so
- Repeat for a new vertex $u$ as long as there is one not yet in an SCC
Worse case do a DFS, which is $O(V+E)$, $O(V)$ for every component of which there are $O(V)$, giving $O(V^2(V+E))$ 

### Less Naïve Algorithm
- Do a DFS from every vertex to construct reachability matrix
- Pick vertex $u$
- For every vertex $v$ that it can reach, check if $v$ can reach $u$
- Assemble a list of all of the $v$'s that can and $u$, this is an SCC
- Repeat for each vertex as long as there is not yet one in an SCC
$O(V(V+E))$, as we do $V$ DFS's to make the matrix.

## Kosaraju's Algorithm
Let $C$ and $C'$ be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph $G=(V,E)$, let $u, v \epsilon C$ , let $u', v' \epsilon C'$ and suppose that $G$ has a path $u -> u'$. Then $G$ cannot also contain $v'->v$ .

Let $C$ and $C'$ be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph $G=(V,E)$, such $f(C') > f(C)$, a DFS through $G^T$ starting from any $C'$ vertex, will reach all vertexes in $C'$ and none in $C$.

We can design an algorithm for finding the SCCs of a given graph G:
- DFS G to construct postorder
- For each vertex in reverse postorder:
	- If already visited, continue
	- Start DFS through $G^T$ from that vertex adding each vertex it encounters to the same SCC as the start
- Return list of SCCs
```python
def dfs_postorder(adjlist: list[list[int]], visited, root: int) -> list[int]:
	postorder = []
	def dfs(current: int):
		if not visited[current]:
			visited[current] = True
			for neighbour in adjlist[current]:
				dfs(neighbour)
			postorder.append(current)
	dfs(root)
	return postorder

def transpose(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
	result = [[] for _ in adjlist]
	for u in range(len(adjlist)):
		for v in adjlist[u]:
			result[v].append(u)
	return result

def kosarajus(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
	# Concatenate trees to find forest DFS postorder
	postorder = []
	visited = [False for _ in adjlist]
	for i in range(len(adjlist)):
		if not visited[i]:
			postorder.extend(dfs_postorder(adjlist, visited, root=i))
	adjlist = transpose(adjlist)
	visited = [False for _ in adjlist]
	# Each tree in forest will be an SCC
	sccs = []
	for i in reversed(postorder):
		if not visited[i]:
			sccs.append(dfs_postorder(adjlist, visited, root=i))
	return sccs
```
$O(V+E)$
