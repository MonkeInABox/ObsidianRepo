## Shortest Path
- The length of a path in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path
- The shortest path between vertices `v` and `u` is any path from `u` to `v` such that no other path has lower length
- The single source shortest path problem asks us to find the shortest paths from that vertex to every other vertex
- Shortest paths have optimal substructure, any shortest path is a one vertex extension of another shortest path

## Bellman-Ford
- For any vertex `v`, if there exists `(u,v)` such that appending `v` to the path form `s` to `u` gives a shorter path to `v`, then we replace it. We call this process relaxation of the edge
- Therefore, if we already have all shortest paths that use at most `n` edges, then after a round of relaxation, we have all shortest paths that use at most `n+1`
- There exists a single zero-edge path, the path from `s` to itself
- Since no shortest path needs to contain a cycle, none must require more than `|v| - 1` edges
- `O(VE)`
```python
def bellman_ford(num_verts: int, edges : list[Edge], source: Vertex):
	dist: list = [None for _ in range(num_verts)]
	pred: list = [None for _ in range(num_verts)]
	dist[source] = 0
	for _ in range(num_verts-1):
		for u, v, w in edges:
			if dist[u] == None:
				continue
			if dist[v] == None or dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
				dist[v] = dist[u] + w
				pred[v] = u
	return dist, pred
