## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
- A DAG is a directed graph containing no cycles
- Any oriented tree is a DAG
- DAGs can be thought of as an extension trees that allows multiple parents
- DAGs are often used to analyse dependencies between tasks such as in build systems, as a cyclic dependency would be impossible to fulfil

## Topological Sort
- A topological sort of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is an ordering of the vertices $V$ such that for all edges $(u,v)$, $u$ appears before $v$ in the ordering.
- Commonly just called toposort
- Equivalent to sorting by a partial order relation corresponding to E
- Gives an order in which tasks can be completed such that their dependencies will have been met by the time they are needed
- May be multiple valid orderings for a graph

## Kahn's Algorithm
- Any source vertex with no incoming edges can go at the front of the list
- Once a vertex is in the list, any outgoing edges are safe and can be removed
- Other vertices may now be sources
- Repeat until all vertices are in the list
``` python
def kahns(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
	in_degrees = [0] * len(adjlist) # Count in-edges for each vertex
	for vs in adjlist:
		for v in vs:
			in_degrees[v] += 1
	sources = [u for u, d in enumerate(in_degrees) if d == 0]
	toposort = []
	while len(sources) > 0:
		u = sources.pop() # Pick arbitrary source
		toposort.append(u)
		for v in adjlist[u]: # Maintain degrees and sources
			in_degrees[v] -= 1
			if in_degrees[v] == 0:
				sources.append(v)
	return toposort
```
- For Kahn's  to fail, there must be some subgraph in which no vertex is a source
- Kahn's must work for all DAG
$O(V+E)$

## DFS Toposort
- Kahn's works by taking sources
- Can we toposort backwards by taking sinks?
- A sink is a dead end
- Postorder DFS will visit a node only after its children have a dead-end
- Reverse this to get valid toposort
$O(V+E)$
``` python
def toposort_dfs_recursive(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
	toposort = []
	visited = [False] * len(adjlist)
	def dfs(u: int):
		if visited[u]:
			return
		visited[u] = True
		for v in adjlist[u]:
			dfs(v)
		toposort.append(u) # Postorder
	for u in range(len(adjlist)):
		dfs(u) # Make sure every vertex is visited
	toposort.reverse()
	return toposort

def toposort_dfs_iterative(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
	toposort = []
	visited = [0] * len(adjlist) # Number of times popped
	stack = list(range(len(adjlist))) # Make sure every vertex is visited
	while len(stack) > 0:
		u = stack.pop()
		if visited[u] == 0: # Preorder operation
			stack.append(u)
			for v in adjlist[u]:
				stack.append(v)
		elif visited[u] == 1: # Postorder operation
			toposort.append(u)
		visited[u] += 1 # Increment visit counter
	toposort.reverse()
	return toposort
```

## Shortest Path in a DAG
- Knowing a toposort of a DAG can enable us to solve some problems much faster than in general
- Consider finding the shortest paths from some vertex in a DAG
- Every prefix of a shortest path is a shortest path
- The shortest path to vertex $v$ is therefore just the shortest path to $u$ with the edge $(u, v)$ appended
- Normally a large part of shortest path algorithms is figuring out what order to solve vertices in 
``` python
# Returns list of dists from s to each vertex, or None if no path
def dag_dists(adjlist: list[list[tuple[int, int]]], s: int) -> list:
	order = toposort([[v for v, _ in vs] for vs in adjlist])
	dists: list = [None] * len(adjlist)
	dists[s] = 0
	for u in order:
		if dists[u] is None:
			continue
	for v, w in adjlist[u]:
		if dists[v] is None or dists[u] + w < dists[v]:
			dists[v] = dists[u] + w
	return dists
```
