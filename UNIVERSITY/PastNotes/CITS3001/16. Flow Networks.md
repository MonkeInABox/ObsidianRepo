- In reality, many systems represented as graphs will have limited capacities. We can't send every car down the shortest path because the roads will get congested. 
- A flow network is a directed graph in which every edges has a capacity $c(u,v)$.
- We designate a source vertex $s$ and a sink vertex $t$
- A *flow* is a particular configuration of flow through a flow network where $0\leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)$ is the flow through $(u,v)$

## Maximum Flow
- Asks us to find the maximum total flow we can push from the source to the sink in a flow network
- We use $|f|$ to denote the flow from $s$ to $t$

## Ford-Fulkerson
- As long as there is a route by which we can push more flow from the source to the sink, do so.
- Here is a flow config of $|f| = 22$:
![[Pasted image 20240930160407.png]]
- We know that the possible *max* flow is $23$ but the $(s,c)$ edge is at capacity, as is every edge out of $a$, so there is no route that can push more flow. 
- We can redirect flow through $(c,a) \implies (c,d)$ instead, and replace flow into $a$ using $(s,a)$. We have effectively pushed flow backwards through $(c, a)$
- So the edges available are not just any with remaining capacity, but also the reverse of edges with flow through them that can be reduced. 
- We call these capacities *residuals*. The residual graph is as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240930163727.png]]
`NOTE THE 5 FROM s to a SHOULD BE A 7`
- We call a path from $s$ to $t$ an *augmenting path*. In this case, there is a single bottleneck of 1
- We *augment* the flow configuration using the augmenting path by increasing the flow through any forward edges and decreasing through any back edges
- Therefore the method is as follows:
	- Construct residual graph from flow network with zero flow
	- While there exists a path from s to t in the graph:
		- Select an augmenting path and find its bottleneck
		- Push as much flow as the bottleneck can handle
		- Update the residual graph to reflect augmentation
	- When there are no more augmenting paths, we found a max flow config
- The algorithm (original implementation) finds each path by DFS the residual graph
- $O(|E||f|)$ where $|f|$ is the max flow, worst case capacity (bottleneck of 1 at every step)
```python
def ford_fulkerson(caps: dict, s, t):
	# caps is the capacities
	# Ensure reverse edge exists for every edge
	for u in caps:
		for v in caps[u]:
			if u not in caps[v]:
				caps[v][u] = 0
	# Initialize flow to zero for every edge
	flows = {u: {v: 0 for v in caps[u]} for u in caps}
	# Push flow until unable to do so
	flow = 0
	while True:
		path = find_augmenting_path(caps, flows, s, t)
		if path is None:
			break
		flow += push_flow(caps, flows, path)
	return flow

def find_augmenting_path(caps: dict, flows: dict, s, t):
	parents = {}
	stack = [(s, s)] # Find path by DFS
	while len(stack) > 0:
		p, u = stack.pop()
		parents[u] = p # Could break if u == t, found path
		for v in caps[u]:
			if v not in parents and flows[u][v] < caps[u][v]:
				# ignores saturated edges
				stack.append((u, v))
	if t not in parents:
		return None
	path = [t]
	while path[-1] != s:
		path.append(parents[path[-1]])
	path.reverse()
	return path

def push_flow(caps: dict, flows: dict, path):
# Find lowest remaining capacity along path
bottleneck = inf
	for u, v in zip(path, path[1:]):
		bottleneck = min(bottleneck, caps[u][v] - flows[u][v])
	# Update flows (including reverse edges!)
	for u, v in zip(path, path[1:]):
		flows[u][v] += bottleneck
		flows[v][u] -= bottleneck
	return bottleneck
```

## Edmonds-Karp
- To avoid this, we need to come up with a strategy for selecting augmenting paths that guarantees our algorithm will terminate in a timely fashion
- An augmenting path must saturate at least one edge, saturated edges are removed from the residual graph. Any edges added to the residual graph are in the opposite direction to that of the augmenting path. 
- This means that if we use the shortest path as the augmenting path, it cannot decrease the shortest path length to any vertex
- Since no shortest path is longer than $|V| - 1$ edges, each edge can be saturated at most $O(|V|)$ 
- Since every augmenting path must saturate at least one edge, this gives a limit on the number of augmenting paths that can ever be found
- $O(|V||E|^2)$ (one path found in $O(|E|)$, applying is $O(|V|)$, each path saturates at least one of the $|E|$ edges)
```python
def find_augmenting_path(caps: dict, flows: dict, s, t):
	parents = {}
	queue = deque([s]) # Find path by BFS
	while len(queue) > 0:
		u = queue.popleft()
		for v in caps[u]:
			if v not in parents and flows[u][v] < caps[u][v]:
				parents[v] = u # Could break if v == t
				queue.append(v)
	if t not in parents:
		return None
	path = [t]
	while path[-1] != s:
		path.append(parents[path[-1]])
	path.reverse()
	return path
```

## Cuts and Minimum Cuts
- An s, t-cut is a partition of $V$ into two subsets $S$ and $T$ such that $s \in S$ and $t \in T$
- The capacity of a cut is the sum of all capacities of all edges from $S$ to $T$
- For any flow config, the flow across every s, t-cut is the same
- For any config, we say the net flow across a cut is the sum of all flows from $S$ to $T$ minus any from $T$ to $S$ 
- A *minimum cut* in a flow network is a cut with minimum capacity
- For any cut $S, \space T$ it is clear $f(S,T) \leq c(S,T)$, where $c()$ is the capacity of the config
- Therefore, no flow can be greater than the minimum cut
- If $f$ is a flow from $s$ to $t$ in $G$, then the following are equivalent:
	1. $f$ is max flow in $G$
	2. The residual graph for $f$ in $G$ contains no augmenting paths
	3. $|f| = c(S,T)$ for some cut of $G$ 

*Maximum flow and minimum cut are the same problem*
