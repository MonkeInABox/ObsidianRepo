## Undirected Graphs
>An undirected graph is a pair G = (V, E) of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. For any edge e = {u, v} we say e is incident on u and v, which are connected by e.

## Directed Graphs
> A directed graph is a pair G = (V, E) of a set of vertices V and a set of E. For any edge e = (u, v) we say e goes from u to v, and is incident on both.

## Graph Representations
Things to consider we might want to do with a graph:
- List all vertices
- List all edges
- List all edges from/to a given vertex
- Check if an edge exists
- Find the weight of an edge
- Add/remove an edge
- Add/remove a vertex

## Edge Set/Map
Based on the formal definition, we could just store a set of every edge (and every vertex) in the graph. To associate weights with each edge it is easiest to use a map instead of a set. 
```
V = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'}
E = {
	('A', 'B') : 1,
	(...) : 2, 
	...
}
```
## Subgraphs
- Can be extremely useful to talk about structures that appear within graphs and the properties of these structures. 
- We call types of graphs with particular properties graph classes
	- Mathematicians and computer scientists study many different classes of graphs
- A subgraph of a graph is a subset that is itself a valid graph

## Path Graphs
> A path graph is a connected graph in which exactly two vertices have degree 1 and all others have degree 2. 

## Tree Graph
> A tree graph is a connected graph with exactly one fewer edges than vertices.

## Breadth-First Search
- Use a queue to keep track of order in which vertices become reachable
- Picking next edge requires us to pick the next vertex from queue
- The first edge we see will be the edge used to add that vertex to the tree
- We could therefore mark that vertex as visited, meaning there is no distinction between seen and visited
- O(V) vertices and all O(E) edges, so O(V+E)
```python
# Returns the BFS visitation order starting from root
def bfs(adjlist: list[list[int]], root: int = 0) -> list[int]:
	order = []
	queue = deque()
	seen = [False for _ in adjlist]
	seen[root] = True
	queue.append(root)
	while len(queue) > 0:
		current = queue.popleft()
		order.append(current)
		for neighbour in adjlist[current]:
			if not seen[neighbour]:
				seen[neighbour] = True
				queue.append(neighbour)
	return order
```

## Depth-First Search 
- We can implement using a stack to keep track of which vertices were seen most recently
- Picking the next edge then just requires us to pick the next vertex off the stack
- We can have duplicates this time, and so do need to know when something is visited in order to avoid revisiting it when it comes off the stack later
- O(V+E) complexity
```python
# Returns the DFS preorder visitation order starting from root
def dfs(adjlist: list[list[int]], root: int = 0) -> list[int]:
	order = []
	stack = []
	visited = [False for _ in adjlist]
	stack.append(root)
	while len(stack) > 0:
		current = stack.pop()
		if not visited[current]:
			visited[current] = True
			order.append(current)
			for neighbour in adjlist[current]:
				if not visited[neighbour]:
					stack.append(neighbour)
	return order
```
