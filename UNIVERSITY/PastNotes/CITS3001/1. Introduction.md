## What is an Algorithm?
**Informally**: A well defined computational procedure that takes some input and produces some output.
An **Instance** of a problem is a particular output of a **problem** (some specification of desired output).

## What is a Data Structure?
**Informally**: A way to store and organise data in order to facilitate access or modification.

## What is Complexity?
To evaluate how good an algorithm is, we would like to measure how efficiently it uses its resources available (computation time and memory capacity). Big O notation cares about how fast runtime or complexity grows as inputs get larger and more complex. 

## Problem: Maximum Sum Subarray
*The maximum sum subarray problem requires that, given an array of integers as input, we output the maximum sum of any subarray in the array. A subarray is a contiguous chunk of the array (possibly empty), and its sum is the sum of all values in it.*
**NaÃ¯ve**: Try every candidate and pick the best:
``` python
def max_sum_subarray_naive(xs: list[int]) -> int:
	best = 0 # Can always take empty subarray
		# Try every candidate xs[lwr:upr]
		for lwr in range(len(xs)):
			for upr in range(lwr + 1, len(xs) + 1):
				# Add up the candidate
				total = 0
				for i in range(lwr, upr):
					total += xs[i]
			# Keep track of the best
			best = max(best, total)
	return best
```
This has an O(N$^3$) complexity. (There's O(N$^2$) subarrays and O(N) length)

**Better Way**: Almost every sum is just one element longer than the previous, sum is therefore previous plus new element. We can keep track of sums and moving the start simply resets us to zero. 
``` python
def max_sum_subarray_better(xs: list[int]) -> int:
	best = 0
	for lwr in range(len(xs)):
		total = 0
		# Incrementally grow subarray
		for i in range(lwr, len(xs)):
			total += xs[i]
			best = max(best, total)
	return best
```
This is O(N$^2$).
