- Computer memory is linear, sorting algorithms put a list into sorted order

## Insertion Sort
- Any list of fewer than two elements is trivially sorted
- Given a sorted list, we can insert a new element while maintaining order
- By induction we can start with an empty list and introduce each element from the unsorted list one at a time
``` python
def insertion_sort(xs: list) -> list:
	# Iterate through prefix lengths
	for l in range(1, len(xs)):
		# Insert xs[l] into sorted prefix xs[0:l]
		for i in range(l, 0, -1):
			# xs[i] is element being inserted
			if xs[i] < xs[i-1]:
				# Wrong way around, swap them
				xs[i-1], xs[i] = xs[i], xs[i-1]
			else:
				# xs[i] is in the right spot
				break
			# xs[0:l+1] is now sorted
	return xs
```
- This is O(N$^2$)

## Merge Sort
- Any pair of sorted lists can be merged to give the sorted list of all elements
``` python
def merge(lhs: list, rhs: list) -> list:
	result = []
	# lhs[li] and rhs[ri] are ﻿minimum elements not yet in result
	li, ri = 0, 0
	while li < len(lhs) and ri < len(rhs):
		# Append the lesser element
		if lhs[li] <= rhs[ri]:
			result.append(lhs[li])
			li += 1
		else:
			result.append(rhs[ri])
			ri += 1
	# Append any leftovers
	result.extend(lhs[li:] + rhs[ri:])
	return result

def merge_sort(xs: list) -> list:
	# Trivially sorted
	if len(xs) <= 1:
		return xs
	# Cut the list into halves and recursively sort
	mid = len(xs) // 2
	lhs = merge_sort(xs[:mid])
	rhs = merge_sort(xs[mid:])
	# Merge halves back together
	return merge(lhs, rhs)
```
- This is O(N lg N)

## Decision Tree
- We can draw a binary decision tree of any sorting algorithm, such as this (insertion sort with 3 elements):
![[Pasted image 20240723142322.png]]
- The number of permutations of a list of N elements is N!
- Therefore the leaves must have N! leaves

## Lower Bound on Comparison Based Sorting
- A binary tree of height h may have at most $2^h$ leaves
- Therefore, $N!$ leaves must have at least log $N!$ height, which is the worst case for the algorithm
- **O(lg N!) vs. O(N lg N)**
	- As N -> infinite: lg N! < N lg N
	- Therefore, O(lg N!) is a superset of O(N lg N) and inverse
- lg N! $\epsilon$ $\Omega$(N lg N)  
	- where $\Omega$(f(N)) is the set of functions bounded above and below by f(N)
