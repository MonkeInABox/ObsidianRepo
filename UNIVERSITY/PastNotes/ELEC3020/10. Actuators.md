# Actuators
- Actuators can be built in many different ways, most prominently:
	- Electrical Motors
	- Solenoids
	- Pneumatics and valves
	- Hydraulics and valves

# Motor and Encoder
- Motor speed is determined by supplied voltage
- Motor direction is determined by polarity of supplied voltage
- Cannot generate analogue power signal 
	- Use external amplifier (pulse-width modulation)
- Encoder disk is turned once for each rotor revolution
- Encoder disk can be optical or magnetic
- Single sensor can determine speed
- Dual sensors can determine speed and direction
- Using gears on motor shafts increases encoder accuracy

# H-Bridge
- Allows a motor to be driven in both directions
- Drive forward == close 1 and 2
- Drive backward == close 3 and 4

- Hardware implementation with microcontroller:
	- 2 digital output pins from microcontroller, one for switches 1 and 2, one for switches 3 and 4 feed into relays or power amplifier
	- Alternatively: use 1 digital output pin plus inverter then relays or power amplifier

# Power Amplifier Software Connection
Drive Forward
```
out1 = 1; //direction
out2 = 1; //on
```
Drive Backward
```
out1 = 0; 
out2 = 1;
```
Stop
```
out2 = 0; //off
```
Speed control = use an analogue line for enable would be good.

# D/A Converter and Pulse-Width Modulation
- Digital/Analogue Converter 
	- How can we convert a digital output into an analogue voltage?
		- Hardware: Voltage divider ("resistor grave")
		- Software: Switching power on/off in intervals, this is called pulse-width modulation (PWM)
- How does Pulse-Width Modulation work?
	- We do not change the supplied voltage
	- Power is switched on/off at a certain pulse ratio matching the desired output power
	- Signal has very high frequency (e.g. 1kHz - 20kHz)
	- Motors are relatively slow to respond
	- The only thing that counts is the supplied energy
	- $PulseWidthRatio = t_{on}/t_{period}$
```C++
void setup() {
	//setup PWM: channel, freq., bits resolut.
	ledcSetup(PWM_CH, 500, 8);
	ledcAttachPin(ledPin, PWM_CH);
}

void loop() {
	//changing PWM range, [0..255] for 8 bits
	ledcWrite(PWM_CH, rate);
	...
}
```

# Servos
- A servo is a unit combining motor and simple feedback electronics for position control
- A servo is set by supplying a PWM signal of a certain ratio
- Ratio determines servo position, not speed
- Servos are usually used in model airplanes, etc.

# Stepper Motors
- Stepper motors are another kind of motors that do not require feedback
- A stepper motor can be incrementally driven, one step at a time, forward or backward
- Stepper motor characteristics are:
	- Number of steps per revolution
	- Max. number of steps per second
- Advantages: No feedback hardware required
- Disadvantages: No feedback but often it is still required, requires 2 H-bridges plus amps
