- Running several processes in parallel
	- This is a more general method than background timer routines
- Multithreading is a simpler and faster version, which switches between parallel threads, keeping all of them in memory
- If we only have sequential hardware, the OS takes turns in executing each process

## Pthreads
- POSIX threads
- A thread is best described as a procedure that runs independently from the main program
