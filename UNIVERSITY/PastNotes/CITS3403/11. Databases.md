#### Architecture
- Design patterns describe re-usable design concepts, including:
	- Client-server
	- Pipe and filter
	- Blackboard

#### Model-view-controller Pattern (MVC)
- Model is the data
- Controller receives, updates, queries
- View is presentation and assets
- Advantages:
	- Can alter view without altering the model
	- Can swap database without altering view
	- Specialist developers can work on each bit
	- Can support multiple views
	- Easier to test parts in isolation
- The model is the python objects
- The view is the HTML
- The controller is the code in `routes.py`

#### Mock-ups of views
- Wireframes show the basic layout and functionality of a user interface
- Various tools, or by hand

#### Implementing Models
- A model is an object that is paired with an entity in a database
- There is an **Object Relational Mapping** (ORM) linking the data to the models in the application

#### Relational Databases
- Store data as a set of relations
- Each row is an entity, each column an attribute
- Each has a Primary Key
- Linkages are Foreign Keys
#### Database Management System (SQLite)
- A database management system (DBMS) is an application that controls access to a database
- SQLite as its small and simple
- SQLite commands start with a `.` 
```sql
sqlite3 app.db #creates database

CREATE TABLE contact_groups (
	contact_id integer,
	group_id integer,
	PRIMARY KEY (contact_id, group_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(contact_id)
	ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION
);

.database #shwos file path
.table #lists tables
.schema tableName #shows the schema for a table
.indexes
.exit
```
- In SQL-Alchemy:
```python
class Student(db.model):
	uwa_id = db.Column(db.String(8), primary_key = True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable = False)
	group_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("group.group_id"),                        nullable = True)
	group = db.relationship("Group", back_populates = "students")
```
- Must use `db.session.commit` in order to commit changes
	- Useful so that error messages can be returned, while not having to unwind the database to get rid of errors
- `users = User.query.<SQL syntax>.all()`

#### Database Migration in Flask
- How can you dynamically add things in a table?
- Like version control for your database
- Each is accompanied with *upgrade* and *downgrade* scripts
