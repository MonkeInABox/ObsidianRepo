>A web server is simply a program running on a computer connected to the internet that responds to requests from other computers on the network. This is also referred to as back-end development (so now full-stack development).


#### Different Stacks
- LAMP, Ruby on Rails or Django (Python)
- We will use:
	- Flask: a micro framework, that allows us to write our backend in Python
	- SQLite: a lightweight database management system
	- AJAX: provides the method for transmitting data between the browser and server
	- jQuery: to have bindings for AJAX on the client side.

## Flask
- Micro framework that can be used to create a server program that will run on any machine and has few dependencies.
- Basic "Hello World" Flask application in an `app.py` file
```python
from flask import flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")     #annotate with this, in this case top level
def hello():
	return "Hello World"
if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()
```
- Single file structure does NOT scale well
- Create a Python package that will contain all the code we need for the web app
- The `__init__.py` file creates an instance of the Flask class and `routes.py` contains request handlers
- Then we need a file at top level to support the app. 
```python
#app/__init__.py
from flask import flask
app = Flask(__name__)
from app import routes

#app/routes.py
from app import app
@app.route("/")              #this is an endpoint
@app.route("/index")         #can be multiple endoints
def index():
	return "Hello World"

#microblog.py
from app import app
```
- Endpoints can also use variables: `@app.route("/user/<username>")` where `<username>` is a variable

#### Endpoints
- By default, endpoints are only available as `GET` requests, you can add others though:
```python
@app.route("/login", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
	if request.method == 'POST':
		do_the_login()
	else:
		show_the_login_form()
```
- You can use `url_for` function to retrieve the URL for a given endpoint

#### Server-side vs Client-side Rendering
- Two main approaches:
	- Server-side rendering:
		- the server builds the HTML when it receives the request and sends it to the client
	- Client-side rendering:
		- the server sends JS and an HTML skeleton to the client and the client can then request JSON and build the HTML using AJAX and jQuery

#### Flask Server-side
- Most basic approach:
```python
from app import app
@app.route("/")              #this is an endpoint
@app.route("/index")         #can be multiple endoints
def index():
	user = ("username" : "Miguel")
	return '''
<html>
	...
</html>'''
```
- Alternatively, we can use templates, Flask uses **Jinja** for this
- We would generally have a `template` directory, with variables distinguished by `{{...}}`
```html
<!--app/templates/index.html-->
<html>
	<head>
		<title>{{title}} - Microblogs</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1> Hello, {{user.username}}</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
```python
#app/routes.py
from flask import render_template
from app import app

@app.route("/")
@app.route("/index")
def index():
	user = {'username': 'Miguel'}
	return render_template("index.html", title = "Home", user = user)
```
