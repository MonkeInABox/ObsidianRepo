## What is JavaScript?
- A.K.A. JS
- High-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted language
- An alternative to server-side programming
	- servers are often overloaded
	- client processing is quicker
- Can interact with the internal model of the web page to alter the page dynamically

## Events:
- User's actions are referred to as *events*
- Such as mouse-clicking/interacting

## Executing JS:
- The browser: every modern browser can execute JS, however a HTML file must call the JS function
- NodeJS: a server-side JS environment, more like a traditional console (e.g. python)

## JS on the Browser:
- Several ways to include JS:
	- Inline in a tag attribute (``on click``)
	- Included in the document in the body of a ``<script>`` tag
	- From an external file referenced via a URL, using ``src`` attribute of the ``<script>`` tag

## JS I/O:
- The standard output for JavaScript embedded in a browser is the window displaying the page in which the JavaScript is embedded
- Writing logs or error messages to the document object is now considered bad practice. For simple debugging use ``console.log``, which outputs to console (WOW!)
- To output information to the user, you can use the ``alert`` or ``confirm`` 
- To get input from user, you can use ``prompt``

# Basics of JavaScript
## Variables:
- variable names must start with a dollar `$` symbol, an `_` or any letter and must continue with any combination of these plus numbers. They are usually written in ``camelCase``
- Variable assignment is performed using `=`
- Variables are declared using `let`, `const`, `var` or nothing at all:
```js
let z = x + y;
const x = 6;
var stopFlag = true;
zz = z;
```
- Good rule of thumb is use `let` by default

## Syntax:
`// single line comment`
```js
/*
multiple
line
comment
*/
```
- Statements *should* be terminated with a `;`, however the interpreter will insert the semicolon, but you should not rely on it as it may not put it where you want

## Primitives and Objects:
- Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined
- Some object types: Function, Array, Date, Math, etc.
- Object properties are accessed by `.`
	- `Math.sin()`
- Objects are automatically collected when there no longer exists any reference to them

## Numbers:
- All `Number`s are represented internally as double-precision floating-point
- All standard arithmetic operators, incrementors and compound assignment operators are available in JavaScript
- Convert a string to an integer by using ``parseInt("124")``
- Invalid operators return a special value `NaN` or "Not a Number"
	- This can be checked via `isNaN(value)`

## Strings:
- A string literal can either be double or single quotes
- `\\` to use a literal backslash
- `\n` for new line
- `\t` for tab
- Characters are single length strings
```js
charAt(number_value); //returns character at spot
indexOf("a"); //returns index of character
substring(0, 3); //returns substring from position 0 to 3
toLowerCase();
toUpperCase();
toString(1234); //returns string of the number
"con" + "cat" = "concat";
```

## Booleans:
- JavaScript is much the same as other languages, return values of `true` and `false`
- `!`, `&&` and `||` can all be used
- These are also equal to `1` and `0` respectively

## Loops:
```js
let triangle = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
	triangle += i;
}
//triangle = 6
```

## Arrays:
- Lists of elements indexed
- Begin at zero, size can be modified
```js
var index;
var fruits = ["banana", "orange"];
for (index = 0; index < fruits.length; index++){
	text += fruits[index];
}


let a = Array(10);
//makes an array of length 10
let b = Array();
//creates an empty array
let c = Array(10, 2, "three", "four");
//create array of length 4 with the 4 elements contained
```

# Functions
```js
function <name> (<parameters>) {
	<statements>
}
```
- Parameters do not have a defined type
- Parameters named in function definitions are *formal parameters*
- Parameters passed in are *actual parameters*
- A property array called arguments holds all the actual parameters:
```js
function findMax(){
	let max = -infinity;
	for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
		if (arguments[i]  > max){
			max = arguments[i];
		}
	}
	return max;
}

findMax(4,5,6);
```

# Scopes
- The scope is the range of statements over which it is visible
- 3 types:
	- Global
	- Function
	- Block
- Different variable declarations differ what scope:
	- `const` and `let` have block-level scope
	- `let` can be changed within the block
	- `var` outside of a function has global scope, within, they can only be used within that function
	- Undeclared variables can be used *anywhere*, **DON'T DO IT**

## Inner Functions:
- A function inside another function
- Allow us to use *closures*
	- A closure is the local variables for a function - kept alive after the function has been returned


# Objects
- Collections of name-value pairs:
	- names are Strings
	- values can be any JS value
- Properties can be accessed using `.`
	- `Obj.name = "Matthew Daggit"`
- Alternatively:
	- `Obj["name"] = "Matthew Daggit"`
- `Object.prototype` allows you to modify an object's prototype at run time
- Constructors are functions that create and initialize properties for new objects
```js
	function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
		this.firstName = first;
		this.lastName = last;
		this.age = age;
		this.eyeColor = eye;
	}
	
	var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
```
- ``this`` refers to the current object, in the scope of a browser, that means the window displaying HTML
