#### Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Services where the entire website is provided via client-side rendering:
	- Browser/client does heavy lifting
	- Server only provides data
	- The user never navigates to a new URL
- Pros of SPA:
	- Less load on server
	- A more responsive client
	- Genuine separation between content and presentation
- Cons of SPA:
	- Longer load time
	- Search engine optimisation (SEO) can be an issue
	- Navigation (forward and back buttons) can be an issue

#### Client Side Rendering w/ Web Sockets
- HTTP requests are useful for providing dynamic content but are heavy weight and expensive to setup
- Many web applications depend on real time interaction
- Web sockets provide full duplex communication
- Supported in flask via the `flask-socketIO` package
- `socketIO` is good for message passing chat or distributed games
- `WebRTC` can be used for direct video and audio
- Clients connect to a socket on a server and then the server can push messages to clients
- Sockets mirror routes of a flask project, however they listen for messages and actions and broadcast those
- The server works as a common blackboard for the session and clients listen via jQuery
