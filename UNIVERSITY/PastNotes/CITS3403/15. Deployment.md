### Upgrading to Production-Grade Tools
- We used Flask and SQLite to allow fast development
- For security and scalability reasons, these aren't particularly suitable
- SQLite => MySQL
- Flask => Gunicorn and nginx

### Why Replace SQLite?
- MySQL is a server database rather than an embedded database, meaning it can run on entirely separate machines and act like a server for multiple web servers
- Means better in production and scales well
- Also has inbuilt authentication methods that keeps your data secure even if your VM is compromised
- Easy to replace

### Why Replace Flask Server?
- In a production system, common to decompose the web-server into two separate servers:
	- A public facing *reverse-proxy server* that serves cached static content, handles load balancing and handles SSL encryption
	- One or more private *origin servers* that contain the actual logic of the web application
- We will use **Gunicorn** as the origin server (installable as Pip)
- **Nginx** as the reverse-proxy server:
	- For dealing with external traffic and serving static content
	- Does several things:
		- Routes all traffic through HTTPS so it is encrypted
		- Caches any static data served to improve efficiency
		- Handles public-key encryption/decryption

### Deploying the Website
#### Via Linux VM
- The server runs applications listening to ports for requests and serves those requests
- As most people don't want to worry about the physical infrastructure they use hosting solutions
- These include Amazon, Azure and etc. where you register an account and request an instance, you have a user account with login details, that allows you to SSH into the VM and configure and deploy your app from the command line
- Steps should be taken to secure the server:
	- Remove passwords for login and use key files instead
	- Disable root logins
	- Use a firewall to only accept traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
	- Route all web requests through HTTPS, HTTP traffic is transmitted in plaintext and is visible to intermediate nodes

#### Via Your Own Physical Server
- Can use something such as a Raspberry Pi, and connect it to a wireless router and then access the administrator interface of the router

#### Via Cloud Containers
- There exists a lot of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) products, largely doing away with having to set up a server, manage storage and maintain infrastructure
- **Containers** are often used to put your web app in its own little transportable box that stays the same no matter what, they standardise the software you've written, along with all the dependencies so it runs the same from one environment to another
- Services such as **docker** and **Heroku** don't offer full Linux VMs but a container to run a single process as a service, they install code directly from Git repository, install all the dependencies and execute and initialise the app
