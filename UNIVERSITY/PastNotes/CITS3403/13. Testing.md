Many various ways; in order of effectiveness:
- Code reviews: peer reviews
- Testing: providing test cases
- Formal verification: building precise specifications of correctness and proving code meets these specifications

#### Types of Tests
- Unit tests: test an individual function to ensure it behaves correctly
- Integration tests: execute each scenario to make sure modules integrate correctly
- Systems tests: integrate real hardware platforms and test their behaviours
- Acceptance tests: run through complete user scenarios via UI

#### Unit Tests
The purpose of a unit test is to test an individual function, using 2 to 5 per function.
Properties include:
- Automated
- Repeatable
- Run quickly
- Pinpoint the failure
- Limited in scope
Often "test doubles" are used, such as:
- Fakes: objects with working implementations, but not the same as the production environment, for example, the full database has been replaced by a fake
- Stubs: objects that hold predefined data to respond to specific requests
- Mocks: like stubs but remember the calls they receive

#### The Python `unittest` Module
Provides several classes and functions:
- **Test Fixtures** prepare for a test case, called `setUp` and `tearDown` which run before and after
- **Test Case** is the standard class for running a test, specifying fixtures and functions to execute
- **Test Suite** allows tests to be run together and run at the same time
- **Test Runner** responsible for running the test

#### Creating a Mock DB in Flask
`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///:memory"` creates a non-persistent database in memory rather than as a file on disk.
`Config` class holds the options shared between all configurations, subclasses hold options specific to a particular configuration:
```python
class Config:
	SQL_ALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
	SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("FLASK_SECRET_KEY")
class DeploymentConfig(Config):
	SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///" + os.path.join(basedir, 'test.db')
class TestConfig(Config):
	SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///:memory"
	TESTING = True
```

#### Writing Unit Tests
The name MUST begin with `test` and use `assert` methods to define whether it passes.
```python
def test_password_hashing(self):
	s = Student.query.get("01234587")
	s.set_password("bubbles")
	self.assertTrue(s.check_password("bubbles"))
	self.assertFalse(s.check_password("rumbles"))
```
- This is then run using `python -m unittest <filename>`

#### System Tests
Integrate real hardware platforms and test their behaviour. In the web, this means testing the behaviour of how the application works in a browser. 
**Selenium** is one possible program that can be used to automate browsers to run test cases; two variations:
- Selenium IDE: a browser plugin that can record interactions and run them back to confirm the outcome stays the same
- Selenium WebDriver: a set of tools for scripting system tests
