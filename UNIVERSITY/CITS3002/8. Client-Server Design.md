#### Client/Server Software Architectures
- Client/server computing takes this a step farther by recognizing that those modules need not all be executed within the same memory space
- The calling module becomes the client (that which requests a service) and the called module becomes the server

#### Partitioning Client/Server Responsibilities
- We must address a number of issues:
	- Is there a functional partition at all?
	- Is there a data-driven partition?
	- Is there an extensive use of global variables?
	- Are there any hidden intra-application communication mechanisms (vars, excepts, or signals)?

#### Two Tier and Three Tier Architecture
- Two tier is one where a client talks directly to a server, typically used in small environments (<50)
- Three tier introduces another server (agent) between the clients and the traditional service, providing various services (vertical scaling)

#### Concurrency in Servers
- Concurrency is derived from using a non-queuing model of execution, either by using a copy of the server to support each client, or to provide faster response to each client
- Clients leave their concurrency to the OS
- Concurrent servers are multiple simultaneous requests, iterative is one at a time

#### The Internet Supervisor Daemon - `inetd`
- One problem with having many internetworking services supported, each OS host requires many daemons just waiting for incoming connections on their reserved port, consuming memory and a process slot
- Solution is a 'super daemon' listening for incoming connections on many ports
