## Layered Protocols:
1. ***Name the seven layers of the OSI Networking Reference model, from the lowest to the highest.***
	1. Physical
	2. Data-Link
	3. Network
	4. Transport 
	5. Session
	6. Presentation
	7. Application
2. ***List 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of strictly conforming to a layered networking standard, such as the OSI/ISO networking model.***
	Advantages:
	1. It is a generic model that can be used as a guidance tool to develop a network model
	2. It distinctly separates services, interfaces and protocols, hence it is flexible, one layer can be altered often without affecting others.
	Disadvantages:
	1. It is purely theoretical and does not consider the availability of appropriate technology
	2. There is a duplication of services like error control offered by multiple layers of the model
3. ***Data encryption of network traffic can, arguably, be employed in a number of layers of the OSI/ISO Reference model. If you were to employ encryption in exactly 2 layers, which layers would you choose, and why?***
	
4. **A system uses an _n-layer_ protocol hierarchy. Applications generate messages of _M_ bytes each. At each of the layers, an *h* byte header is added. What fraction of the network bandwidth is filled with headers?**
