#### Automated Development of Distributed Applications
The complications of layering in the OSI model come to a head in the Session Layer and a number of recent developments have 'bypassed' many of the OSI layers
These have been motivated by:
- Speed
- Distributed and replicated file systems
- Remote process invocation and control
- Network aware programming languages such as Java
- Increased need for distributed security

#### Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Paradigm
Based on the observation that procedure calls are a well understood mechanism for control transfer. The proposal is that procedure calls may be consistently extended to access remote environments (other machines).
When a remote procedure call is invoked:
- The calling environment is suspended
- Any parameters are passed across the network to the remote environment
- Results are marshalled back to the caller and its execution resumes

#### RPC Execution Order
1. The client calls a local procedure (*client stub*), which appears to the client that the stub is an actual procedure, the purpose is to package arguments to the remote procedure
2. The network messages are sent to the local kernel using a sys call
3. The network messages are then sent to a remote kernel 
4. The *server stub* has been waiting on any client's request, unmarshalling the arguments from the network messages and converts them to its format
5. The SS then executes a local procedure call 
6. When the procedure finishes, it returns to the SS
7. The SS then converts the return values if necessary and builds one or more network messages
8. Messages traverse network
9. The CS reads the replies from the local kernel
10. The CS returns to the calling procedure, control flow is again in the clients code

#### SUN Microsystem's RPC Compiler `rpcgen`
- Many OS's provide RPC within their kernels and as a standard library of routines
- SUN's RPC package consists of `rpcgen` a compiler for creating remote procedure call server and client stubs, the XDR for encoding data into a portable manner

#### Naming and Interface Binding
- Most OSs now supporting RPCs use a replicated database used to store server addresses
- When a server restarts (boots) it informs the database that it is alive and passes the programs number, version and port number
