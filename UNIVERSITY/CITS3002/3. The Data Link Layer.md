- The Data Link Layer provides the following services between the physical and network layers:
	- bundling and unbundling groups of bits into *frames* for the physical layer
	- *throttling* the flow of frames between sender and receiver
	- detecting and correcting "higher-level" transmission errors, such as the sequencing of packets from the network layer
### 3 Levels of Data Link Layer Complexity:
- **Simplex connectionless** - the sender simply sends its frames without waiting for the receiver to acknowledge them. No attempt is made to detect or re-transmit lost frames. Most modern LAN technologies (such as ethernet) use this method and leave error resolution to higher layers. A.K.A. unacknowledged connectionless service.
- **Half-duplex connectionless** - each frame sent is individually acknowledged. Frames which are lost or garbled are retransmitted if the receiver requests them (again) or after a suitable timeout. A.K.A. acknowledged connectionless service.
- **Full-duplex connection-oriented** - each frame is individually numbered and is guaranteed by the data link layer to be received once and only once and in the right order. The result is that the data link layer presents a reliable frame *stream* to the network layer. A.K.A. acknowledged connected service.
