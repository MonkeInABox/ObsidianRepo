## Simplified Satellite Broadcasting
- Many users share a *single* channel
- Propagation at the speed of light, 300,000km/sec
- However, the *distance* travelled is large, resulting in round trip times of ~270-700msec
- Bandwidth, typically 500Mbps, is currently about 5x higher than typical LAN-based networks as it less limited by speed of local infrastructure
- Cost is the same whatever the distance between sender and receiver
- Satellite acts as a repeater of incoming signals, amplifying and re-broadcasting these signals
- If 2 stations broadcast simultaneously, the satellite will receive and re-broadcast the *sum* of these 2 signals, resulting in garbage. This is a **collision**
- A sender can listen to a re-broadcast of their own packets and determine whether a collision has occurred, however there are **no acknowledgements**
- Users are uncoordinated and can only communicate via the channel
	- Therefore, the satellite must control its own allocation
- Advantages of this approach (shared medium):
	- No data link layer acknowledgements needed, as users can verify themselves
	- No routing problems in the Network Layer (no subnet!!)
	- No congestion problems or topology optimization
	- Mobile users may be supported
- Disadvantages:
	- Long propagation delay of at least 270ms
	- All users receive all messages

## Channel Allocation
- 2 common schemes:
	- **Polling**:
		- satellite or ground offers the channel to an individual user for a specified amount of time
		- Delays, making this impractical 
	- **Frequency and Time Division Multiplexing**:
		- 2 Forms:
			- FDMA (frequency division multiplexing), channel is divided into N frequency bands for a maximum of N users, guard bands are placed between these limits
			- TDMA (time division multiplexing), channel is divided into slots based on time intervals, each user using a channel for that certain amount of time
		- Both are inefficient as the number of users is "bursty"
