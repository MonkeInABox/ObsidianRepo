## Simplified Satellite Broadcasting
- Many users share a *single* channel
- Propagation at the speed of light, 300,000km/sec
- However, the *distance* travelled is large, resulting in round trip times of ~270-700msec
- Bandwidth, typically 500Mbps, is currently about 5x higher than typical LAN-based networks as it less limited by speed of local infrastructure
- Cost is the same whatever the distance between sender and receiver
- Satellite acts as a repeater of incoming signals, amplifying and re-broadcasting these signals
- If 2 stations broadcast simultaneously, the satellite will receive and re-broadcast the *sum* of these 2 signals, resulting in garbage. This is a **collision**
- A sender can listen to a re-broadcast of their own packets and determine whether a collision has occurred, however there are **no acknowledgements**
- Users are uncoordinated and can only communicate via the channel
	- Therefore, the satellite must control its own allocation
- Advantages of this approach (shared medium):
	- No data link layer acknowledgements needed, as users can verify themselves
	- No routing problems in the Network Layer (no subnet!!)
	- No congestion problems or topology optimization
	- Mobile users may be supported
- Disadvantages:
	- Long propagation delay of at least 270ms
	- All users receive all messages

## Channel Allocation
- 2 common schemes:
	- ### **Polling**
		- satellite or ground offers the channel to an individual user for a specified amount of time
		- Delays, making this impractical 
	- ### **Frequency and Time Division Multiplexing**
		- 2 Forms:
			- FDMA (frequency division multiplexing), channel is divided into N frequency bands for a maximum of N users, guard bands are placed between these limits
			- TDMA (time division multiplexing), channel is divided into slots based on time intervals, each user using a channel for that certain amount of time
		- Both are inefficient as the number of users is in "bursts"

## Local Area Networks
> "A LAN is a routerless network, using the same protocol stack for each device, and using only uniform, local, networking media."
- LANs are between about 10 - 0.1km in separation with a bit rate of 100 - 10,000Mbps
- Machines connect to a single cable within a 1km radius (often same building or campus)
- Total data rate >10Mbps (due to short round trip time and simple data bit layer)
- Single organization ownership
- Usually use broadcasting (no routing problems, but everyone sees all frames)

## Carrier Sense Networks
- All stations can *sense* the electrical carrier before sending
	- This is possible because of the use of high speed cables over short distances
- Factors affecting CSMA (carrier-sense multiple access) LANs:
	1. All frames are of constant length
	2. There are no transmission errors
	3. No capture effect
	4. Random delay after collision is uniformly distributed and large compared to the frame's transmission time
	5. Frame generation attempts form a Poisson process with mean G frames per time
	6. A station may **not** transmit and receive simultaneously
	7. Each station can sense the transmission of other stations
	8. Sensing of the channel state can be performed at the same time as transmitting
	9. The propagation delay is small compared to the frames' transmission time, and identical for all stations
- ***Persistent CSMA Protocols:***
	- Each station first senses activity on the channel
	- If stations A and B are waiting for C to finish, they pause until they sense it is free, transmit with a probability of 1
	- The longer the propagation delay = the more collisions, worse performance

## IEEE-802.x LAN Standards - The Ethernet System
- Uses a 1-persistent CSMA with collision detection (CD) method
- Each packet must be at least 64bytes to provide reasonable chance to have collisions be detected over long propagation times
- Due to power losses in Ethernet cables, each segment cannot exceed 500m, so repeaters used to connect up to 5 into a single LAN, this and other physical properties of ethernet are specified in IEEE-802.3

### Ethernet Contention Algorithm
- Each station wanting to transmit, listens to the ether and on finding it silent, begins transmission
- On detecting a collision: (called *binary exponential back off*)
	- Backs off for random period
	- After first collision backs off for 0 or 1 times slots before trying again, second, 0, 1, 2, or 3 times
	- In general a station will back off from 0 to 2<sup>i-1</sup> times after the i<sup>th</sup> collision
	- After 16, it considers it "severed"

## Packet Transport Mechanisms
- Each station connects to the ether with a transceiver, failures of this transceiver must not pollute the ether, power failure must not cloud it, and disconnection must not be noticed by the other stations
- ### 5 Significant Mechanisms to Reduce Prob and Cost of Losing a Packet
	1. Carrier detection (phase encoding which guarantees at least one phase transition)
	2. Packet error detection
	3. Interference detection (each transceiver has an interference detector)
	4. Truncated packet filtering (hardware is able to filter them out)
	5. Collision consensus enforcement (deliberately jamming the ether to ensure the other colliding stations hear the collision as quickly as possible)

## Hubs, Switches and Collision Domains
- A collision now occurs when a device or LAN-segment receives two or more signals simultaneously.
- A hub will retransmit the frame to *ALL* of its outgoing ports, whereas a switch will more 'intelligently' retransmit the signal to the ports known to be wanting the frame. 
- A collision domain is the set of devices (potentially) receiving a frame collision. 

## IEEE-802.11 Wireless LAN Protocol
- Of interest is not just the maximum possible transmission rate, but the distance over which WiFi may operate
- The unit **dBm** is defined as the power ratio in decibel referenced to one milliwatt. It represents absolute power, a WiFi access point (AP) will typically transmit up to 100mW, and a receiving device will typically be able to discern signal from noise until -90dBm

## Hidden Node
- The method of simply waiting until the airways are clear, such as wired, in wireless networks does not work, because not all nodes are within range of each other

## Collision Avoidance
- Most wireless cards are unable to both transmit and receive at the same time on the same frequency - they employ *half-duplex* transmissions
- This means collisions cannot be detected while transmitting
- It employs collision *avoidance* to reduce the likelihood of collisions occurring. The algorithm is termed Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA), where both *physical channel* sensing and *virtual channel* sensing are employed
	- Basically; before transmitting data frames, the sender and receiver must first exchange additional control frames before the 'true' data frames. The success or failure of this initial exchange either reserves the medium for communication or directs how the sender, receiver and all other nodes should act
