- The data link layer had the responsibility of reliably transmitting frames across along a single wire (or wireless) link
- Network layer's responsibility is to get packets from an actual source machine to a destination machine
- The lowest OSI layer that has to deal with end-to-end transmission
- It must be aware of the immediate topology of its subnet to make routing choices

## Network Layer Design Objectives
- The design objectives of an effective Network Layer are:
	- to be independent of processor and communication technology
	- to be independent of the number, type and topology of the subnets
	- to provide a uniform addressing scheme for all hosts in the network

## Responsibilities of the Network Layer
- The network layer includes nearly all of the functions we consider important in multi-node networks
- Each node can be responsible for everything from handling its own links to managing the network topology
- Three types of requirements:
	- **Source and destination functions:** end-to-end protocols, network layer software interface, fragmentation and reassembly of messages, management of network layer sequence numbers, and creation, manipulation and deletion of headers.
	- **Store and forward functions:** choice of the best route for packets, local flow control and local error control
	- **Network-wide management functions:** network flow control, topological awareness and modification, and network performance measurement and monitoring.
- *Further explanation of packet fragmentation and reassembly*:
	- Messages divided into smaller data units (packets) before transmission, they travers the network independently and then the destination stitches them back together, using each packet's header to see where they go
	- This has benefits of a fixed buffer size, prevents congestion at destination and they require simpler memory allocation schemes

## Network Layer Header Management
- The NL header is created in the source node, examined in intermediate nodes and removed at the destination node

## Path of Frames and Packets
- Whereas the data link layer must acknowledge each frame once it successfully transverses a link, the NL acknowledges each packet as it arrives at its destination

## Network Layer Routing Algorithms
- The routing algorithms are the part of the Network Layer software that decides on which outgoing line an incoming packet should go
	- for virtual circuits: route is chosen each session
	- for datagrams: route is chosen for each packet
- Desirable properties for the routing systems are similar to those for the whole network layer:
	- correctness, simplicity, robustness, stability, fairness and optimality
- Robustness is significant for 2 reasons:
	- Once a large network is off and running it is difficult to change the routing algorithm software
	- Network topologies often change - hosts, IMPs and lines frequently fail
- The better a routing algorithm can cope with changes in topology, the more it is

## Two Classes of Routing Algorithm
- Non-adaptive
	- the choice of routes between two hosts are computed in advance and loaded into each host in the whole network
	- often called static routing
	- Example: Flooding, where initially every incoming packet is retransmitted on every link, which gives it the shortest package delay and is robust to machine failures. However, it *does* flood the network. Some possible improvements include not retransmitting it on the link they came from, acknowledgements are sent through *only* this link
- Adaptive
	- attempts to adjust their route choices based on their current knowledge of the network topology
	- Three types:
		- global use information periodically collected from whole network
		- local algorithms use only the information that each router knows about itself
		- combined use both
	- often called dynamic routing
	- Example: Distance Vector Routing, where it maintains a table in each router of the best known distance to each destination and the preferred link to that destination. However, if the reliability is uncertain, we may encounter the count-to-infinity problem, where if a router goes down, that distance/time is infinite. If router A crashes, B may want to send via C, then C does the same to B and so on to infinity. 

## Congestion and Flow-Control in the Network Layer
- If too many packets are dumped into some part
