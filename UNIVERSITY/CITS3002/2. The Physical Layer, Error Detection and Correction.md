## Physical Layer Responsibilities:
- Provides topology of network
- Provides transfer medium
- \[TX] Encodes data into a transmission signal supported by medium
- \[RX] Decodes data into a transmission signal supported by medium
- \[TX+RX] Generates or amplifies re-transmitted signals along the medium
- \[RX] Monitors transmission errors
- \[RX] Detects arriving signal levels to synchronize speed and timing

## Data Link Layer Responsibilities:
- \[TX] Constructs data frames using the format of the physical layer
- \[TX] Calculates Cyclic Redundancy Codes (CRC) information
- \[RX] Checks arriving error using CRC information 
- \[RX] Initiates and arbitrates the link to reduce interruption and contention
- \[RX] Examines arriving and passing device addresses in data
- \[RX+TX] Acknowledges receipt of a frame
- \[RX+TX] Retransmits data if there is an error

## Metrics of Network Measurement:
- We want high bandwidth and low latency
- **Latency/Propagation Delay**: amount of time it takes for the first bit to reach its destination. Round-trip time (RTT) is twice the latency. 
- **Bandwidth**: the number of bits that can be fit through a network connection, per unit time.
- **Throughput**: usually the measured number of bits per second, while bandwidth is the nominal bits per second possible. 
$$
T_{latency} = T_{propagation} + T_{transmit} + T_{queue}
$$
$$
T_{propagation} = distance/speedOfPropInMedium
$$
$$
T_{transmit} = messageSize/bandwidth
$$
$$
T_{queue} = timeSpentInLocalAndRemoteOSAndSwitchQueues
$$

## Transmission Errors:
- Usually occur in bursts and are caused by:
	- thermal background noise
	- impulse noise, electrical arcing
	- distorted frequency
	- crosstalk between adjacent wires

## How Data Is Placed In Frames:
- Simple timing gaps between frames cannot be used as all hardware devices run at slightly different speeds; resulting in skewing if time is relied upon
- To overcome synchronization problems, special byte sequences are often used to prefix and suffix the data, so byte stuffing using DLE, STX and ETX

## Phase Encoding Of Signals:
- A digital signal is a sequence of discrete, discontinuous pulses or signal elements
- If all signal elements have the same sign, they are unipolar
- The modulation rate of a LAN is the number of signal elements a second (baud rate)
- Two simplest encoding schemes:

- Biphase encoding ensures that there will be a transition in the middle of each bit:

## Error Detection and Correction:
- Data may be modified so that errors can either be:
	- detected
	- corrected
- Correction is required where communication must be simplex (only possible in one direction), but it is expensive. A good example of its need is between Earth and inter-planetary spacecraft. 
- Error correction by receiver is *forward error correction*, re-transmission schemes are referred to as *reverse error correction*.
- The **HAMMING DISTANCE** between two codewords consists of the number of bit positions in which they differ. The difference is performed via XOR.
	- The Hamming distance of a code is the minimum Hamming distance between any two words in that code. 
- To detect δ errors, a distance of δ + 1 is required
- To correct δ errors a distance of 2δ + 1 is required so that even with δ errors, the damaged codeword is the closest to one valid codeword

## Hamming's Correction of Single-Bit Errors:
- m bits for the message, and r bits of seemingly redundant information, therefore we transmit $$ n=m+r $$ when transmitting a message.
- Each of the 2$^m$ possible message words has n illegal code words which are a distance 1 from it. Therefore, each message word requires n+1 distinct bit patterns. 

## How Does Checksum Error Detection Work?
1. Break original message into k blocks of n bits
2. Sum all k blocks
3. Add the carry to the sum and take the 1's complement
4. If when the receiver sums the k blocks and the check sum block and it adds to all 1s, then it accepts the data, otherwise it is wrong

## How Does CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Work?
1. Find the length of divisor ('L' in this example)
2. Append L-1 bits to the original message
3. Perform binary division operation
4. Remainder is the CRC
	1. The CRC hence is L-1 bits
