## Physical Layer Responsibilities:
- Provides topology of network
- Provides transfer medium
- [TX] Encodes data into a transmission signal supported by medium
- [RX] Decodes data into a transmission signal supported by medium
- [TX+RX] Generates or amplifies re-transmitted signals along the medium
- [RX] Monitors transmission errors
- [RX] Detects arriving signal levels to synchronize speed and timing

## Data Link Layer Responsibilities:
- [TX] Constructs data frames using the format of the physical layer
- [TX] Calculates Cyclic Redundancy Codes (CRC) information
- [RX] Checks arriving error using CRC information 
- [RX] Initiates and arbitrates the link to reduce interruption and contention
- [RX] Examines arriving and passing device addresses in data
- [RX+TX] Acknowledges receipt of a frame
- [RX+TX] Retransmits data if there is an error

## Metrics of Network Measurement:
- We want high bandwidth and low latency
- **Latency/Propagation Delay**: amount of time it takes for the first bit to reach its destination. Round-trip time (RTT) is twice the latency. 
- **Bandwidth**: the number of bits that can be fit through a network connection, per unit time.
- **Throughput**: usually the measured number of bits per second, while bandwidth is the nominal bits per second possible. 
$$
T_{latency} = T_{propagation} + T_{transmit} + T_{queue}
$$
$$
T_{propagation} = distance/speedOfPropInMedium
$$
$$
T_{transmit} = messageSize/bandwidth
$$
$$
T_{queue} = timeSpentInLocalAndRemoteOSAndSwitchQueues
$$

## Transmission Errors:
- Usually occur in bursts and are caused by:
	- thermal background noise
	- impulse noise, electrical arcing
	- distorted frequency
	- crosstalk between adjacent wires

## How Data Is Placed In Frames:
- Simple timing gaps between frames cannot be used as all hardware devices run at slightly different speeds; resulting in skewing if time is relied upon
- To overcome synchronization problems, special byte sequences are often used to prefix and suffix the data, so byte stuffing using DLE, STX and ETX

## Phase Encoding Of Signals:
- A digital signal is a sequence of discrete, discontinuous pulses or signal elements
- If all signal elements have the same sign, they are unipolar
- The modulation rate of a LAN is the number of signal elements a second (baud rate)
- Two simplest encoding schemes:
