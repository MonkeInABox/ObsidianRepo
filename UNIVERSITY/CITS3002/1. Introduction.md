## Definitions:
- Computer Network: an interconnected collection of autonomous computers
	- interconnected if they are capable of exchanging information
- Computers are autonomous if there is not a permanent master/slave relationship between them. 

## Internet Protocols:
- Consists of an agreed format for messages, expressed by a packet header, an optional message component, and a set of rules for the exchange of messages between computers.
- Must -
	- happen in an agreed order
	- travel from the sender to the correct receiver(s)
	- contain the correct unambiguous data

## ISO/OSI Reference Model:
- We require protocols to "meet" new computers, ask for information, agree to share data, etc.
- Open Systems Interconnection/International Standards Organization
- The 7 layer model:

1. **THE PHYSICAL LAYER**: is responsible for transmitting a (raw) bit stream over the physical communication medium. 
2. **THE DATA-LINK LAYER**: takes the bit stream from the physical layer and constructs logical chunks of data termed *frames*.
3. **THE NETWORK LAYER**: is responsible for providing the connection between "end systems" across a network. Network layer functions include:
	1. Routing: deciding how to transmit frames between source and destination using addresses
	2. Relaying: enables data transfer across intermediate networks
	3. Flow control: matches traffic flow with physical capacity of a transmission path
	4. Sequencing: control ordering of frames across a network
4. **THE TRANSPORT LAYER**: provides a reliable end-to-end service independent of the network topology. This is achieved by splitting messages into network sized packets and joining them back together again at the other end.
5. **THE SESSION LAYER**: is the upper layer crucial to internetworking and manages the dialogue between end systems. Typically provides:
	1. establishment and closing of connections
	2. synchronization to allow checking and recovery of data
	3. negotiation of full and half duplex communication
6. **THE PRESENTATION LAYER**: provides a standard format for transferred information by overcoming compatibility problems between systems using dissimilar data encoding rules and possibly different display technologies. 
7. **THE APPLICATION LAYER**: provides the interface between the application processes. In particular, functions such as file transfer, remote job execution and application dependent virtual terminal support are provided.
