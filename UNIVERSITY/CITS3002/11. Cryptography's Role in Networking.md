### ISO/OSI Security Architecture
- Includes the requirements:
	- **Data Confidentiality** - protects data as it traverses the network from being disclosed to incorrect parties.
	- **Data Integrity** - protects the data from the modification or removal while in the network
	- **Data Origin Auth** - validates the sender of the data
	- **Data Receiver Auth** - validates the receiver of the data
	- **Peer-entity Auth** - validates all network components through which a data stream must travel
	- **Non-repudiation** - creates and verifies evidence that the claimed sender sent the data and likewise with the receiver

### Where should encryption be performed?
- Users encrypting individual files stored in a standard file-system
- File-systems encrypting all data before writing it to disk
- Datalink and network layers in switches and routers (VPNs, etc.)
- Session layer with end-to-end data conversion (SSL, etc.)
- Application layer in programs like email agents (PGP, etc.)

### Terminology
- Plain Text -> Cipher Text
- The intended receiver should be able to quickly and correctly reverse
- Following attacks are common with the goal of determining cryptographic keys:
	- known plaintext attack
	- chosen plaintext attack
	- differential analysis
