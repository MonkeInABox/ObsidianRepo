# Session 1 - Quest for the Crates

The ramp crunches down onto the leaf-littered floor as you walk down it, out onto the surface of [Castrovel](Castrovel). The weapon crates that you have been hired to find that have fallen from a shipment to the industrial moon of [Elindrae](https://starfinderwiki.com/wiki/Elindrae), which is visible in orbit about the planet. The trees crowd in on you, in the distance you can see the elvish architecture of [Qabarat](https://starfinderwiki.com/wiki/Qabarat), suddenly you hear a beep beep beep as the comm system that you were given by the employer began to buzz.

A scrappy looking ysoki answers, someone different from who hired you. “Are you the ones we’ve hired for this job?”

“Yeah, yeah ok I get it. I trust you all know the nature of this mission?”

You have been hired to pick up some supply crates that have been dropped on this planet a few days ago in the jungle-like area that spreads out in the opposite direction of the city, you have not been told what is in them, nor should you ask any questions, you have simply been tasked to pick them up and return them to the ship, collecting the reward. The city is in the east, at the entry point between the river that is flowing past you and the ocean, and the heavy part of the jungle in the west.

If go into city:

Clearing: the three crates are sitting there in the clearing, miraculously not damaged despite falling some hundreds of metres from the atmosphere speeder.

When back to the ship, you get offered to be chartered to [Absalom Station](https://starfinderwiki.com/wiki/Absalom_Station). Mid-way through travel, the ship shudders, blue-light flashes throughout the hallways periodically, the light emanating from small LEDs placed in the ceiling.

“This is the Pact World Republic speaking, please allow us to board temporarily for a routine search of this ship. It would be greatly appreciated if we were not met with any resistance, for both ours and your benefits.”

You hear stomping down the halls, the signature sounds of the republic officers’ boots clanging against the painstakingly polished metal floor of the ship. “Alright, round everyone up, we have reason to believe there are illegal arms on this ship.” You hear one of the officers mutter to the others. “These are the fuckers that plan on blowing the under settlements of Absalom Station sky-high, or space high I guess..”

Three of the soldiers that were about the ship with you went towards the boarders, weapons raised and scowls on their faces.
