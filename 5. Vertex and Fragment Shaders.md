## The Rendering Pipeline and Sahders
![[Pasted image 20250311110448.png]]
- The goal of the **vertex shader** is to provide the final transformation of mesh vertices to the rendering pipeline
- The goal of the **fragment shader** is to provide the colour to each pixel in the frame buffer

# GLSL Shading Language
> OpenGL Shading Language
## Data Types
``` C
//scalar
bool //bool var = true
int
uint
float
double

//vector
bvecn //vector of bools
ivecn //vector of signed int 
	ivec2 myvar = ivec2(-1, 2);
uvecn //vector of unsigned
vecn //vector of single precision fp numbers
dvecn //vector of double precision fp numbers

//matrices
matn //matrix with n rows and n columns
matnxm //matrix with n columns and m rows
	mat3 Matrix;
	Matrix[1] = vec3(1.0,1.0,1.0); //set second column all to 1.0
	Matrix[2][0] = 15.0; //sets first entry of third column to 15.0
```
## GLSL Qualifiers
- A qualifier is used to modify the storage or behaviour of variables
- **Storage** qualifiers: attribute, uniform, varying
```c
const vec4 point = vec4(1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0);
attribute vec4 vPosition; //specify per vertex data
//uniform is used as attribute that are shared between shader and application, must be global eg. light source position and cannot change in vertex or fragment shader
uniform mat4 projection;
uniform floar temperature;
//varying declares variables that are shared between vertex and fragment shaders, must be declared identically
varying vec4 colour;
```
- **Precision**: highp, mediump, lowp
```c
//used to specify highest, medium and lowest precision available for variables
precision precision_qualifier type;
//Using a lower precision might have a positive effect on performance
```
- **Parameter**: in, out, inout
```c
void myFunc(in float inputVal, out int outputVal, inout float inAndOutVal);
//FOR EXAMPLE
void myFunc(in float inputVal, out int outputVal, inout float inAndOutVal) {
	inputVal = 0.0;
	outputVal = int(inAndOutVal + inputVal);
	inAndOutVal = 3.0;
}

void main() {
	float in1 = 10.5;
	int out1 = 5;
	float out2 = 10.0;
	myFunc(in1, out1, out2);
}
//in1 = 10.5, out1 = 10, out2 = 3.0
```
		- **IN** is intended to have a value when it is passed into a function, but it is not be changed in the function
		- **OUT** is not assumed to have an initial value the first time it appears, but will be assigned a value before the function is returned
		- **INOUT** is intended to have a value when passed and when returned, maybe different
## Passing Values
- A variable declared **out** in vertex shader can be declared as **in** in fragment shader and used
```c
//vertex shader
const vec4 red = vec4(1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
out vec3 colour_out;

void main(void){
	gl_position = vposition; //this is coming from application program
	colour_out = red;
}

//fragment shader
in vec3 colour_out;

void main(void){
	//can use colour_out here
}
```

# Built-in Variables in Shaders
## `gl_Position`
- A special state variable, which is the position that will be passed to the rasteriser, and must be output by every vertex shader, we need not declare it in the shader
```c
in vec4 vPosition;
void main(){
	gl_Position = vPosition;
}
```
