## Eulerian Paths and Cycles
- An Eulerian Path (walk, trail) in a connected graph is a path which visits every edge exactly once
- An Eulerian Cycle (circuit, tour) is an Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex, forming a cycle
- Eulerian paths can be transformed into Eulerian cycles by adding an edge from end to start and the reverse
- An Eulerian cycle must leave every vertex as many times as it enters it. This is not possible if any vertex has odd degree
- By removing an edge between start and end, we can see that the same is true for Eulerian paths, except that the start and end must have odd degree
- A simple algorithm would be to just attempt to walk every possible path and check if it is Eulerian, but there are potentially $O(|V|^{|E|})$ paths to check
- If we can prove that there is always an Eulerian cycle for any connected graph with all vertices of even degree that could help, but it is tricky to prove

## Hierholzer's Algorithm
- Consider a connected graph in which every vertex has an even degree (even number of edges per node)
- Take an arbitrary walk from an arbitrary starting vertex, "removing" edges as we use them
- At each step, only the degrees of our current position and where we started are odd, every other vertex is stepped into and out of, keeping it even
- Keep going until we hit a "dead-end" which has no remaining edges to leave from
- A dead end must have degree one when we step into it, so it must be where we start from
- Removing the cycle may disconnect the graph into components but it reduces the degree of each vertex by an even amount, so all even degree
- Since the original graph was connected, we know at least some vertex in each component must be in our cycle, then find a new cycle in that component from there, which can then be merged into the main cycle
- Repeating, must walk all edges, hence finding an Eulerian cycle. Each edge walked once, so $O(|E|)$ 
```python
# Assumes Eulerian cycle exists (all verts even degree, etc.)
def hierholzers(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
	path = []
	def walk_cycle(u: int):
		nonlocal path
		while adjlist[u]:
			v = adjlist[u].pop()
			adjlist[v].remove(u) # Would be O(1) if Python had multisets
			walk_cycle(v)
		path.append(u)
	walk_cycle(0)
	path.reverse()
	return path
```

## Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles
- A Hamiltonian Path in a connected graph is a path that visits every vertex exactly once
- A H. Cycle is a H. Path that starts and ends at the same cycle
- By using a backtracking search, mark vertices as unvisited as it backs out of them
```python
# Note: Inefficient implementation for clarity
def hamiltonian(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list | None:
	# Recursive backtracking search
	def backtrack(u, visited):
		visited.add(u)
		if len(visited) == len(adjlist):
			return [u]
		for v in adjlist[u]:
			if v in visited:
				continue
			if path := backtrack(v, visited.copy()): # Don't share visited
				return [u] + path # Prepend u to path
	# Try all starting vertices
	for u in range(len(adjlist)):
		if path := backtrack(u, set()):
			return path 
```
- Don't care about order, we can then memoize our backtracking search
#### Using D.P.
- State: A current `v` and a visited set `U`
- Recurrence: Picking valid next vertex
- Base Case: If everything is visited `(U==V)` then we have found a solution
$$f(u,U) = any(f(v,U\cup\{v\}|v\notin U,(u,v) \in E))$$
$$f(u,V) = True$$
- Every step adds an element to the visited set which is never removed, so this gives an evaluation order. 
$O(2^{|V|}|V|^2)$ overall
```python
def hamiltonian_dp(adjlist: list[list[int]]) -> list | None:
	V = len(adjlist)
	# dpt indexed by visited bitset and u, value is next vert
	dpt: list = [[None] * V for _ in range(1 << V)]
	# Base case: Everything visited, mark as own next step
	dpt[(1 << V) - 1] = [v for v in range(V)]
	# Fill the DP table from larger visited to smaller
	for visited in reversed(range((1 << V) - 1)):
		for u in range(V):
			for v in adjlist[u]:
				if visited & (1 << v):
					continue
				if dpt[visited | (1 << v)][v] is not None:
					dpt[visited][u] = v
					break
	# Find a vertex from which there is a solution
	for u in range(V):
		visited = 1 << u
		if dpt[visited][u] is None:
			continue
		# Trace back the path
		path = [u]
		while (v := dpt[visited][path[-1]]) != path[-1]:
			visited |= 1 << v
			path.append(v)
		return path
	return None
```
## Complexity Classes
- Seen basic ones:
	- Set of all problems solved in $O(|N|)$
	- Set of all problems solved in $O(|N|^2)$
	- Set of all problems that aren't solved in $O(|N|)$
- Decision problems: algorithm outputs *yes* or *no*
- A Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM) is a theoretical machine with the following:
	- Arbitrarily long data tape (memory)
	- Read/Write head for tape
	- A deterministic finite state machine(DFSM) that controls head
- Each step, head reads cell and feeds to DFSM:
	- What value to write?
	- Whether to move left or right
	- What FSM state to transition to
	- Whether to halt?
- Time is then the number of steps performed by the machine
- A Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM) has an NFSM
	- At each step the NFSM can propose multiple different actions, machine picks randomly
- **P** "Polynomial time": Decision problems can be solved in polynomial time by a DTM
- **NP**: "Nondeterministic Polynomial Time": either
	- Decision problems solved in NTM
	- Decision problems verified in DTM
- **NP-Hard**: Problems at least as hard as any in NP
- **NP-Complete**: Problems that are both NP and NP-hard
