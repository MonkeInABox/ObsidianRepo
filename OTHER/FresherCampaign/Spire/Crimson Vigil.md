The blood moon, or hunter’s moon, hangs in the sky once each month and casts a dull, crimson light over the world. It is this facet of the moon that the dark elves call Lekolé, or Our Lady of Vengeance, and her form is a terrible thing to behold: she is a many-armed, towering spectre of destruction, a fire-eyed wraith the colour of blood, and she preaches purity through annihilation.
