The Azurites have devoted their lives to buying and selling. Clad in their trademark blue robes (and adorned with blue scarves, hats, buckles, flowers and jewellery) they make a habit of buying low and selling high, maintaining an awareness of the markets, and knowing precisely who to sell what to. Given their exposure to a wide variety of other cultures, they all possess a brief understanding of many local languages and dialects â€“ and often have no problem picking up new information or adapting what they know to fit.
