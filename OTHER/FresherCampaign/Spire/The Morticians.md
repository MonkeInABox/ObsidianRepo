The primary function of the Morticians is to properly dispose of corpses, and thereby, ensure that the unquiet spirits of the dead do not plague Spire. Under Spire law it is illegal for anyone other than a Mortician to dispose of a body, so the guild has lucrative ties to the Garden district where it sells on bodies to mushroom farms. Wealthier clients are permitted to be torn apart by the corvids and vultures that cluster and flap about the turrets of New Heaven, and the very wealthiest are interred in one of the few patches of unoccupied dirt in private cemeteries.
