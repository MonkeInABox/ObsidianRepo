### [[Crimson Vigil]]
The blood moon, or hunter’s moon, hangs in the sky once each month and casts a dull, crimson light over the world. It is this facet of the moon that the dark elves call Lekolé, or Our Lady of Vengeance, and her form is a terrible thing to behold: she is a many-armed, towering spectre of destruction, a fire-eyed wraith the colour of blood, and she preaches purity through annihilation.

### [[The Azurites]]
The Azurites have devoted their lives to buying and selling. Clad in their trademark blue robes (and adorned with blue scarves, hats, buckles, flowers and jewellery) they make a habit of buying low and selling high, maintaining an awareness of the markets, and knowing precisely who to sell what to. Given their exposure to a wide variety of other cultures, they all possess a brief understanding of many local languages and dialects – and often have no problem picking up new information or adapting what they know to fit.

## [[The Morticians]]
The primary function of the Morticians is to properly dispose of corpses, and thereby, ensure that the unquiet spirits of the dead do not plague Spire. Under Spire law it is illegal for anyone other than a Mortician to dispose of a body, so the guild has lucrative ties to the Garden district where it sells on bodies to mushroom farms. Wealthier clients are permitted to be torn apart by the corvids and vultures that cluster and flap about the turrets of New Heaven, and the very wealthiest are interred in one of the few patches of unoccupied dirt in private cemeteries.
