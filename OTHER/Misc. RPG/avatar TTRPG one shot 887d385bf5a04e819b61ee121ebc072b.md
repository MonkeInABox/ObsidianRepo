Clues:

- On the table, another piece of paper, same home-made feel and smell, however it does not have the gold-leafing around the outside. It reads:
    - “I demand 2000 gold in return for your daughter back.” Written in a rather fancy, well-written script

Characters:

- Lei: worried mother

- Rose: daughter who is missing

- Detective Ziming

- Cong

- Peng

Lei’s palace, detective Ziming is there, having been hired by Lei to investigate her daughter Rose’s disappearance. Detective Ziming has not been very useful in the investigation so far, it has now been two days since the daughter has gone missing. The only further information given is that there is a carnival in town today, there is talk of a slight uptick in gangs in the city, hence why Lei is so worried and Rose’s room is upstairs.

The carnival:

Cong, the leader for the paper-crane gang, is trying to cover for them. They have been asked to take out the flying-koi gang, in order to allow Cong to develop his gang further, and so that Hua and Rose can leave.
