OWASP Top 10: ”Open Web Application Security Project”

Finding Vulnerabilities:

- Scanners

- Penetration Testing

SQLi

- A malicious user injects some malicious SQL code into a web application

- Can be used for data theft, or unauthorised access/data modification

- To protect, use input sanitisation, or SQL DB encryption

Command Injection

- An attack that allows a malicious user to inject crafted shell commands into vulnerable web applications. These commands are then executed by the applications to break the CIA triad

XSS

- XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable web page that is viewed by other users (phishing websites, etc)
