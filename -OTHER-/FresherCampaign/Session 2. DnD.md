Head into the black market, known as Duskfall Markets, its held in a dingy close group of streets concerningly close to the walls of city. There are creatures of all types and species making loud noises, anything from squawks to barks. 

There is obviously some sort of cage fighting going on in the back

"COME ALL COME ALL TONIGHT WE HAVE A SPECIAL EVENT! WE ARE ACCEPTING GROUPS, AND THOSE WHO WIN WILL GET A NIGHT ON THE HOUSE."

You see a gangly drow standing on a crate with a black cloak bound by what looks like a gold coin.
