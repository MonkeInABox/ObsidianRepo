If they get past it, there is a small locked door that goes into the servant's quarters
The servants are gracefully not there at the moment

Walking out there is a hall that leads to a lot of chattering
Otherwise a staircase upwards, getting significantly more fancy

There is a shadow demon on the landing

There is a room at the top with the leader, who explains how the king was part of a group that was attempting to bring back the Lich in order to gain supreme power over the lands.
However, their murder was too late as the summoning ritual is still in process by the other leaders of the country
