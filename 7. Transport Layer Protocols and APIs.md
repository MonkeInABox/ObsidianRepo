#### Ports
- 16-bit positive number software end point
- Address specific OSs on a host, IP addresses just do the hosts
- Some ports are reserved (443 for HTTPS)

#### What TCP/IP Provides to Applications
6 Major Features:
1. Connection Orientation (one program must first request a connection before communication proceeds)
2. Reliable Connection Start-up (both must agree to connection)
3. Point-to-Pont (each session has **EXACTLY** 2 endpoints)
4. Full-Duplex
5. Stream Interface (application sees data as a continuous sequence)
6. Graceful Connection Shutdown
It also establishes a 3-way connection establishment and sequence numbers (agree on numbers sent and receive for added security), also lets two hosts synchronise

#### TCP/IP Retransmissions
- Employed between processes physically nano-seconds apart to almost a second
- As there is a sliding window protocol, timeouts are employed to force re-transmissions
	- TCP maintains a dynamic estimate of the second round trip time for each connection, as they change

#### Congestion Control
- Adaptive window control

#### Network Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
- It is preferable if the API to network I/O exhibit the same semantics as a file, stream, I/O but this is difficult for a number of reasons:
	- The typical client-server relationship is *not* symmetrical
	- Network connections may be connection-oriented or connectionless
	- Identification is more important to networking than for file operations
	- More associations to be made for network I/O than file I/O (files generally aren't changed depending on when it is opened)
	- Many file I/O models presume all data is in a continuous stream

#### Sockets (Brief)
- Applications can specify the destination *each* time they use the socket
- Current (kernel) socket implementation consists of three parts:
	- The socket layer provides the interface between user programs and networking
	- The protocol layer supports different protocols in use
	- The device driver supports the physical devices such as ethernet controllers
